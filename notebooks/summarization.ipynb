      " what are you guys talking about this cd is damm much better then anything out there time of our lives is a very good song with good vocals go to hell bitches ya hear this is good music okay can t get better then this folks this whole line is really great different look than normal and is really striking used this as a relish tray for different olives pickles etc a lot of uses for a cute plate like this would buy again highly recommend the matching set villeroy boch new wave cottage piece serving set i am mine is a great song which is well written by vedder from a very personal aspect his vocal is excellent with his trademark baritone being very clear the music is also excellent with the use of a keyboard adding to that excellence mcready s guitar solo at the end of the song is one of his best down is a slighty more punchy song with very simple lyrics that are good to sing along to a very good b side and a very good song a powerful look into the life of a courageous and brilliant young woman thought provoking i couldn t be happier with the crate i purchased i read the reviews about the sharp edges but mine does not have any edges that seem sharp to me this is extremely sturdy as well thank you i was jonesing for music from the band i had just purchased rock of ages and noticed that i could also get the last waltz an incredible concert the disc is in excellent condition and i received my purchase within days thank you i have used this a few times since receiving it as a gift for christmas easy to use easy to follow directions perfect for hobby cake decorators like myself i used three replacement lawnmower blades for exmark mower decks on my dixie chopper and i am completely satisfied my mowing style is quite abusive on blades these blades are heavier and thicker than the originals a nice even cut with no bends breaks or cracks thanks s cothren my mom wanted to get this for the kids so i ordered it for her my kids have so much fun playing all the different games on this board even my yr old can play most of the games roxxi is one of the bratz dolls that always makes a bold look roxxi looks nice in her outfit but should haveworn more red anways she is still cute and worth every bit of your money buy your daughter roxxi and not a ugly fugly my scene crap headdoll love ruby tuesdayps thanks a bunch if you want to support me at the bottom of your review write i support ruby double thanks this record knocks me out goodbye to all those tasteless dull years of listening to rock n roll hello to the new millenia and art of noise i bought this device to connect an imac to a home entrainment system when i first tried to do this i got hum presumably due to a ground loop with this device added which i assume is an isolation transformer the hum is gone and the sound quality is good what a great movie tons of action tons of movie stars lots of explosions and action it has a decent storyline abt a debacle in africa must of had a billion extras in this movie but anyways storyline abt a mission goof up that cost the us rangers and delta force quite a bit of time to evacuate their forces that were stranded in hostile territory realistic fight scenes and a glimpse into how the terrain and fighting might have looked like i loved this movie as a child and i just recently bought it to watch it again and its still an awesome movie all the specail effects and everything are just amazing special for the movie in that time it was made in and if you watch movies from then they are really cheesy and the special effect kind of suck but all in all this movie is great i love it america s mass media has one agenda to sell americans a war or a product in the case of yugoslavia their agenda was to sell us a war it is always wise to investigate before consenting to something as drastic as war in the case of kosovo because of the way the media presented the story to the us americans thought they had a sure fire righteous cause to bomb dr parenti with his careful research and patient laying out of the facts will wake up sleeping americans who bought the mass media s story with the actual facts readers beware your conscience will bother you if you cheered america s interference in kosovo a land that was traditionally serbian for hundreds of years before croatian catholics and albanian muslims moved in was it really the fault of the serbs read to kill a nation before deciding the book is an excellent resource of e business and e government literature valuable lessons can be learned from the book as it elaborates on e commerce initiatives and policy implications in several countries and other topics i like the way the book is organized and find it easy to read through the book has been organized into three sections e commerce initiatives and policy implications policy implication for networked smes in supply chain and policy push and monitoring several chapters in the book elaborate on topics related to my current research projects reading through these chapters will be very helpful in this regard a concise effective book that provides all the basics for building a good oral argument the advice is practical and presented in a succinct little book that can be read in one sitting although it lacks material on the academic aspects of oral argument it is full of practical advice and great ideas for presenting effectively well worth the time and money this movie may look slightly dated now but eddie murphy s film debut in this flick still remains one of his best i still find parts of this movie simply brilliant and nick nolte s performance is equally as good as cop jack cates and convict reggie hammond constantly spar verbally and physically but with the same goals in mind the performances and strength of the characters really bring out both the drama and comedy in this film which balance superbly i won t bother going into the story as many other reviewers have done this but this movie is simply hilarious in places and is a must see for anyone who likes an adult comedy movie for the record the sequel is equally as good i ordered this dvd to help my daughter understand more about alexander hamilton she had to read money men for school and i felt a few history dvd s would help her understand the material better i agree with the other reviews in that the video is well produced and easy to watch yes there could be more detail on his accomplishments and yes there could be more detail on some of his bad ideas we all have them i was happy with my purchase and will buy more like them the essential rousseau is an edition of as its name suggests rousseau s most essential works including his discourse on the arts and letters and discourse on the origins of inequality in their entirity as well as excerpts from other major works including the social contract and the savoyard priest the translation is clear and accurate the selection of tests is appropraite and accurately reflects what i would consider to be essential there s a good brief sketch of rousseau s life and work in the beginning and a quick introduction to each work all in all this is a fine edition for assignment in the classroom and for students i bought this book for my three year old sean it has rapidly become his favorite bedtime story it has fun rhymes with a good meter and wonderful pictures sean also took it to daycare for show and tell where it was also a big hit we like the gruffalo s child so much we have ordered the book that preceded it the gruffalo if a more comprehensive and thoughtful guide has been written on this subject i ve never seen it the book may have been put out by teen magazine but the insights within will inspire and challenge anyone from i recommend it as a definite must read i was trying to make a scarf with a pattern that had a lot of bobbles and my metal hook was not working very well it would take me hours to do less than bobbles i bought a plastic light up hook hoping for better results and was still having difficulties i finally looked for bamboo hooks in a few different stores and couldn t find any or just none for the price i was willing to pay i finally found these online and bought them and they were exactly what i was needing i was able to finish the scarf that night i was and still am extremely happy with these hooks this is a classic early reader very simple and repetitive for young children it s a bit long for toddlers and some preschoolers might find the subject matter too frightening being lost not knowing where your mama is however i still recommend having this book in your library if it s too much for your kid this year it might be just right next year this has got to be one of the most captivating movies i have ever seen never before have i been as moved by a movie as i have by this one this is a don t miss movie for everyone i know i have watched it a dozen times now and will keep on watching it i have been on looking for an electric slicer and didn t really know much about what to get what not to get etc i finally decided on the chef s choice and couldn t be happier it is so easy to set it up and just as easy to use it is easy to set up easy to use has adequate safety features and cleans up in a jiffy i also ordered an additional slicer since i was going to be using it for proscuitto and it was only about but it has been coming in handy as i ve been using it quite often and worth the spending the extra for it to have it cut the slices the way i want for the price of this slicer definitely recommend it it s great on to c is a very well written book it describes every topic clearly and completely and does not skip over anything however it is a little short and it does not explain some non c parts completely it gives a very skimpy paragraph or so on reading data from files also it does not give any recommendations or even basic instructions for buying and using compilers on to c describes and explains c very well but it is somewhat sketchy in describing certain areas related to programming i bought about different calendars as gifts last year this was the funniest and best received of them all if is anything like s was it will bring a smile to your face every single day i definitely recommend it i can t believe how many people have commented on this book i can t wait to read it i know it will inspire me i hope it will inspire others what this country and world need right now is a lot of inspiration we have kitchenaid qt pro series mixers in our cake shop and they don t miss a beat we run them for hours at a time they do get hot push alot of wattage but work great i purchased this toy box for my best friend when she was having her first son and then i bought a diff tox box for my son s room and wish that i had bought this one now my friend is now expecting her second child and wants the same tox box for him also it is huge the only gripe that she has is that the lid comes off but otherwise it does it s job and does it well it deff holds all of his toys the durable plastic is also nice especially for boys who climb on and into everything very safe and very big a must buy this mf bp monitor is awsome i can t believe how small portable and easy to use it is it is quick and easy and has large read out numbers i thought it would be big and clunky when i ordered it and saw how cheap the price was but was really surprised at how sleek and small it really is looks like it cost way more than i paid for it nice sleek carrying case too i take my bp first think in the morning when i wake up and it is a snap to use easy to see the large read out even with blurry eyes first thing in the morning this was a christmas gift that i bought at a book fair for my grandson who is almost six he loved this book he spent hours putting the puzzles together and asking the names of each animal that was shown in the puzzle the puzzle is beautifully illustrated and the animals are identified by numbers two other titles were listed at the end of this book artic and antarctic he has asked for both of these books for his birthday this book is a good choice for any child in this age group i m such a fan of this book that i just bought ten of them to give to people whom i think would connect with it it s not for everyone but if you are on a serious spiritual journey or wish to be then this book is for you it s not just about money but it is about money and it s about how to create your best most fulfilling and abundant life and gives you real tools not just concepts if your gut says yes to getting it just get it be open take what you like and leave the rest i loved just about every word of it i have recommended this book to many people explaining that it is simply one of the best books i have ever read when they ask what it is about i say it is set in late th century england and is about two rogues a young woman and a youngish man who try and steal a rich young woman s fortune by declaring her mad and having her locked up to tell more is to give away the delicious plot twists of this absorbing novel an engaging love story between the two female characters runs throughout adding an element of humanity and tenderness to the story some of the writing is rather dense and it will not appeal to all readers but if you love suspense romance and jaw dropping plot twists you will not be disappointed with this one if you have a stupid incompetent ruthless clueless misplaced overpaid obnoxious arrogant ignorant lazy weird nose picking sob boss or co worker cow orker you ll really enjoy these to the point observations on corporate life in the s it would be difficult to give a detailed and specific review of this movie without filling it with spoilers and this movie is worth seeing fresh in every detail that matters the animation the live action the props and costuming the acting the casting the setting the special features the delightful commentary by the director and the child actors and on and on this film is first rate if the appearance of father christmas the uk s version of santa claus seems a tad disconcerting remember it s in c s lewis original story as much in the film strictly speaking is not of course new zealand is the perfect setting for so much of this film one climactic scene near the end given its geographical setting just might have fans of the lord of the rings expecting gandalf aragorn or the riders or rohan coming in from stage left to smite the white witch and her minions nice clock very pretty design got what i paid for and it was a nice late present for a friend this compilation of newly recorded gems by ms warwick is a must have for die hard fans and for new converts the arrangements are beautiful and they allow ms warwick s now baritone voice to still sound strong and full then came you is especially catchy with dionne doing all her own background work who needs those spinners anyway the best tracks are in between the heartaches and the look of love weakest what a fool believes sorry dionne i ve heard michael mcdonald sing it and he s better this is great i always loved this movie and now i have it on dvdthe pope of greenwich village these poems focus on leave taking and return recording the experiences of rural and urban isolation dislocation and violence and the histories of war and reconciliation in our century they bear witness to the way people endure and continue to love in a time of upheaval beautiful bowen captures the spirituality of vietnam oliver stone vietnam the word has come to define the arrogance of american military power the mindless violence the sheer waste and idiocy of the cold war playing basketball is more than a book an act of healing and generosity the war doesn t go on but the vietnamese people have survived and they survive in kevin bowen s poetry harvard reviewchosen pick of the year by the progressive these sleeves are excellent unlike some of the others here on amazon they re industry standard thickness and fairly reliable nothing cheap and flimsy here however and most unfortunately they come wrapped very tightly in a rubber band that ends up leaving a fairly nasty indentation straight through the center of on both ends of the bundle and crimps in the middle top and middle bottom of all the rest there s absolutely no need for that rubber band to be there and if they really must put a rubber band for some reason then employing the use of a wider rubber band would have resulted in considerably less crimping makes it acceptable for home use but probably not the impression you want to be giving out if you re using these to mail cds or dvds to your customers god damn what a great album these guys really can sing do yourself a favor and buy the cd you will not regret it the best song in the album is ofcourse i want it that way this works just as it was intended to no problems whatsoever i would definitely purchase it again but there will be no need i just finished applying this in my back yard and had no issues with the sprayer it spread evenly across my entire yard nicely not sure how effective the product is yet against mosquitos but the application was not an issue this device works as expected we have a baby prone to ear infections and have been at the doctor times in weeks for fear of ear infections the first two times there was an ear infection we finally bought this device which allows us to look into the ear to help diagnose an ear infection without having to go to the doctor it works it really deserves stars the only downside to this device is that you have to get your eye very close to the magnifying glass to see the inside of the earth which is not always possible with a fussy baby active toddler this safe is generally what you d expect it to be it s solid a good size for personal files hanging folders fit well i haven t had a fire or flood so i don t know how it holds up one minor annoyance you can t remove the keys unless it is in the locked position i have no reason to lock it i m not using it to keep people out just to protect my files in case of fire so i either have to lock it and risk losing the keys or keep the keys sticking out the front at all times which is annoying other than that the product is fine una de las mejores peliculas de drama de harrison ford una pelicula que nos dice que podemos cambiar lo que no queremos en nuestra vida i get great reception in my vehicle i suppose others may vary easy to set up nice that plugging it in gives it not just voltage but a mount so that it isn t dangling or sliding around the passenger seat only reason i didn t go a is that the backlighting is too bright at night for my tastes i absolutely love this album by steve winwood in fact it s his best effort of his career i know what you re saying that s a bold statement if success is measured in album sales then this one is his best hands down however it is his best and the record sales are a bonus this track masterpiece has some of his best songs including higher love back in the high life again the finer things a personal favorite and split decision steve winwood was thrust into the spotlight seemingly overnight and this album depicts the mid eighties pop sound it s a more mature album that appeals to an older as well as younger crowd all of the nice and easy radio stations couldn t get enough of this one back in steve winwood is one of the most talented musicians in the history of music and this is his showcase i m surprised by the negative reviews of this bag i purchased mine before the movie even came out and was not disappointed at all by the quality and craftsmanship i got exactly what i expected to get for the size was as expected and the material as well it looks exactly as it does in the picture i ve received multiple compliments from men and women of various ages and in fact i just returned from italy where i got compliments from various foreigners and traveling americans plus it s a great bag to carry if you re worried about pick pockets and or slash and grab thieves i highly recommend being the victim of a conman i found this book to be amazing no it wasn t a quick money con but the person i worked for was a confidence man and what i learned from my experiences in dealing with him first hand and reading this book wow it s fascinating at how no matter the age the game is the same this book does get a little redundant in parts but the stories the game that s played how it s done those things are all the same and as times evolve so does the hustle this book gives you an inside look at how the mark is done the roots of where the modern con extended from and in all honesty human nature and how easy it is to get played reading this book also gave me some insight into watching the tv show white collar because a lot of the cons they run there have roots from this book if you enjoy true crime and want to know the life of the con then check it out it s worth the money this part was discontinued for my stand and i was told this one would work on my stand and it did i am very please with this item i won this cd on a radio promo i like the single no turning back but i really like next bend in the river i have read many of the negative reviews and am beginning to wonder why people who don t like this book write a lines on why its bad sure goodkind copied but so what who doesn t copy his characters are deep and believeable and his world is worth coming back to and this is what fantasy is about he does have a lot of originality as well confessors mord sith and i seriously doubt that anyone could have seen the ending coming way back on page obviously everyone knows that good will win in the end but i dont buy the book for the ending i buy it for the journey for the pages between page one and the last page so if you are a fantasy fan and like long deep books this one is for you we have just installed this fan just hung it and plugged it in actually installation was a snap with with the included hanger the pull cord changes speeds as well as on and off it oscillates nicely quiet and makes our very warm screen porch comfortable if you can t use a ceiling fan this is a great alternative time will tell how long it works but seems well built but not v ery heavy so it can be installed easily on a wall i read this book after it was suggested to me by a c level executive from cisco system which he claims to resemble how things get done in well run large corporate businesses i ended up reading this book several times and although i do feel that some of the information should be common sense to everyone it doesn t always come natural to think through the scenarios that we encounter in our every day lives in the manner that is presented in the book some people know how to influence people naturally but others like myself have to work at it and this book has helped me create a structure to be able to become a more influential person the only reason i did not give it stars is because i felt that some of the topics did become redundant and the authors could have done a better job at making this book a bit more concise other than that i truly enjoyed this book and i have recommended this book to many colleagues and friends use this product if you re going to be installing spark plugs cylinder head and exhaust head bolts for easy removal later i m a novice mechanic so this tube will probably last me a while wish it came in a smaller tube and it included brush overall its a good product i d buy it again got this because of a medical condition that requires pressure relief of the tail bone region i m a big guy lb so i needed something that would give me cushion for my weight and hold up to activity of getting in and out of the car i have to adjust it since it moves every time i enter or leave the vehicle but it does exactly what it s supposed to do which is give me pressure relief it s not all that expensive since there are others out there for or more i d say if you are looking for something for the first time it s a good start this stuff definitely works as advertised in the dishwasher cleaning stains off of plastic kitchenware and getting rid of odors i highly recommend it we bought a case recently and are about to buy another some bird books are good for identifying species but offer little in the way of behavior diet habitat voice etc this book has all of that plus a nice did you know tidbit on each bird it s pocket sized fits in the palm of one hand and has photos not drawings of many variations differnces for gender and immature ideal for a beginner like me we have friends with a daughter who is hdrocephalic fluid collects around her brain and has a shunt tube running from her head to her belly to drain the fluid since it s very important that she not bang her head this tub was a great choice for them they feel much better about bathing her in an inflatable tub since she is much less likely to injure herself or damage her shunt while taking a bath this movie has been re named three times from mortal combat to crippled avengers and finally return of the five deadly venoms this is a very unique classic in that it displays handicapped martial arts experts who overcome their limitations and seek revenge on the evil villain who forced them to become cripples you really should check out how what specialty an old but very astute instructor teaches each crippled peasant how to rise from helpless victims to superb martial artists must see like other reviewers have mentioned gerber onesies run smaller than stated size buy one size up ie if your baby is in the month old range buy month onesies other than the size issue they are great the cotton is very thin which makes them great for summer and for layering when it is colder out the solid colors are also very nice i heard these guys on the radio over an npr station the night pat murphy died specifically kind of folk music on speed i guess the cd is amazing few cds make me want to get up and dance as much as this one does i ve played it for friends all of whom have slightly eclectic tastes and its become the most popular cd of mine to borrow if you like folksy music played quickly and with passion this is a must own cd the good the game s controls are very responsive there is a good variety of events and cars that allows the game to stay fresh and not become repetitive load times are almost nonexistent in the game the game can be enjoyed by both children and adults adding bonus challenges during certain world tour events such as drifting feet to win cars delivers an added feeling of achievement to the events the bad i wasn t particularly a fan of ea trax the soundtrack maybe its just my taste but i am not a fan of any of the songs the game isn t that challenging its easy to breeze through many events in a row getting a bronze medal at least this is a solid racing game for the psp racing through tracks at breakneck speed is always an enjoyable experience while it closely resembles the other burnout game for the psp burnout legends it differentiates itself enough to at least give it a look this book contains lots of problems the book the summer of the swans is about a year old girl who can t really decide about herself and her ideas about herself change throughout the novel sara s brother is called charlie who is aged ten but has the mind of a three year old due to a childhood illness sara cares for him like a mother one night however charlie goes out to see the swans but gets lost he panics and falls down into a ravine sara looks for charlie with joe melby the alleged person who apparently stole charlie s watch sara finds out that joe is not what he thought he was and they become friends meanwhile charlie is found by sara and joe and she really finds out how much he means to her i liked this novel because it was well planned and had a moral i believe that the novel is also good for people over because plot of the story is sophisticated enough for older readers sun valley serenade was probably the best film glenn miller appeared in john payne joan bari and sonya henie were the stars in the film but sonta henie s ice skating glenn miller and his band along with a scene stealing performance by milton berle really made this movie using biblical scholars from around the world including vanderbilt university theologians and dr ruth this video is a fascinating account of specific types of sex in the old testament and the changing mores of sex in the new testament it s a wonderfully informing documentary which i recommend highly for adults but parental guidance for children deborah smith embree in nashville i liked this book it provided a lot of very specific examples and scenarios of what people with adhd experience especially children i am a fairly new fan of andrea bocelli i saw him on a tv special with celine dion when i heard him sing my heart pounded his voice is so pure yet at the same time sexy i started with aria which i listened to every day until i bought romanza what a beautiful selection of songs his voice and the way he delivers the songs lift my soul to new heights i loved it this light is very bright it does the job in low light settings the only problem is you will not be able to shine this in someone s face it is too bright to be close to people way back when i was barely a teenager someone passed me a copy of the patterns of chaos i was instantly absorbed engrossed in the story and driven to read until the wee small hours to see what happened to bron haltern and his mysterious foes it was the first time i d ever done that and i still after nearly years remember the excitement i ve re read it many times and yes it does have some major plot holes but i d still count it as intelligent space opera just finished the kindle version give it a its a great story to follow with a cast crooks of and degenerates and that world spooks and another opium war we had to have depressing on reflection but also pleasing to see that these people can be discovered if not punished sean egan helps sarah talbot find the ones who were respondsible for her son s death unable to get help from the british police sean relies in his network of friends the problem is though that some are not his friends at all when drug money gets involed a good read with a surprising ending i really enjoyed dexter s journey into understanding his darkness and realizing his light knowing his darkness would not exist without light was just well beautiful i don t usually write reviews but this product is slightly different than the blue swiss army mat they appear to be the same have seemingly identical pictures and are even the same price we ordered one of each to keep the kids from fighting for their mats and it turns out the grey one is inches wider than the blue one i guess these swiss mats must have been built by a confederate gray craftsman who wanted to make the union blue mats inferior this magazine is totally cool it s great for any girl between i ve just turned and i know that soon i ll be too old for it but i think i ll still keep reading it for mom s worried about if it has junk kissing boys etc it has nothing like that it mostly is about how to have a good friendship this magazine has fashion but in a way that helps you to express yourself by fashion know what i mean so it s cool i always have a hard time waiting for it in the mail and it s worth the wait so even though most of the magazines nowadays are all about relationships with boys and ridiculous fashions celebrities and popstars this magazine is for normal girls it s covergirls are normal girls instead of celebrity teens giving the everyday girl a chance to stand out so i think that it is the perfect magazine for any girl because of it s understandable issues appropriate topics cool craft ideas and fun fashion thank you for reading this i hope it has been useful it met all my math need for my college class it cost so much more in the stores great calculator i like the cd and the book very well they complimented each other i learned enough that i wanted to research it more went to carol gurney s website to get more info i would recommend this if ne is interested in communicating with their pets and other animals learnign about how it is done used the pny website to verify this memory would work in my hp laptop it does it works great bought two sticks to max out the laptop now it works better than my desktop everything about this transaction was superb and the product was exactly what i was after in arrived quickly and there were no problems i am a new mom having trouble losing the baby weight i am also a yoga novice this video collection is perfect for my needs it is challenging physically even giving me some cardio yet the moves are easy to understand and the motion is slow and fluid so that i do not feel overextended it also works in segments so that i still feel like i ve gotten a work out even if babe wakes up after only twenty minutes highly recommended for most fitness levels though i don t think someone who is totally new to exercise could handle it you do need some experience with yoga and have good flexibility and core strength author d j levien has struck a raw but accurate nerve in his description of elliot grubman striving middle aged man from the near poor upbringing of brooklyn where he became and remains fixated on the need to garner self respect he throws cash around like autumn leaves in new england in order to buy into the high life and he s got a lot of it from a successful pornography business he built from nothing elliot knows what people want and is under no illusions as to what they will do to get it he just can t connect his past is catching him and his fears abound a good job by a very incisive author this movie is great for counselor who are talking about bullying in classrooms the movie is newer and gets the students attention it also comes with a guide on what to talk about very happy exactly what we were looking for received order very quickly and in time for christmas i borrowed this book from my local library and went to amazon to purchase it it is that informative i am concerned about breast cancer with a family history and am currently on tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer i wanted some answers about using preventative drugs like this and possible alternatives this book has the information i need to further discuss this with my doctor it explains diet supplements and testing in a technical manner but it also summarizes everthing more simply at the end of each step there is a great explanation of estrogen too in tuesdays with morrie one expression sums up the story when you learn how to die you learn how to live during each session with morrie the author grows as he discovers more and more about the person he truly is while he is on his journey to self discovery the reader is also whisked off on their own journey of self exploration many times throughout the book i paused and reflected on the wise words of morrie i was initially drawn to his honest and direct stance on many issues including death fear aging marriage greed society familty forgiveness and a what it means to have a fulfilling life i bought some glass cooktop cleaner from wal mart i gave it away when my husband bought me this and i tried it it works great with very little effort on my part if you have a glass cooktop you need this i am always going to keep one on hand coming from an irish polish family background i found many similarities between firoozeh dumas family and mine and what a hoot a loving hoot that is funny in farsi is not only a book about being an immigrant but more importantly it s a book about what is important in life our families however they may be some of her relatives are dopplegangers for some of mine possibly separated at birth if you would like an uplifting read a good chuckle every chapter and an insight that most families are more interesting and funny than the brady brunch then you won t possibly miss by picking up this gem of a book good product gives better protectionlasts quite well throughout the monthsome similar products lose their effectiveness after weeks definitely recommend this product for general purpose cutting these are the choice they do well in a variety of non abrasive materials just don t push them hard or you will need another pack right away the bits do better if you just let the tool do the work they are kind of hard to control if you want a nice cut but that s the nature of spiral saws the down cutting spiral is nice since the dust is blown away from you instead of back at your face it s pretty simple if you have a spiral saw you need these bits this book is filled with many adventures involving a grandma and her grandchildren her grandson and granddaughter come to live with her because times were hard during the great depression i would recommend this book for kids who are in the th grade or up due to not being about to understand the books because of the big words this book reflects conflict because of problems experienced during the great depression we are very pleased with this camco rv white polypropylenevent lid we ordered two of them both fit well and arrived in great condition i read this book for the first time while spending an unpleasant time aboard the uss abraham lincoln in fact it was the last full month of my time there and in my depths and dives of depression mania held a certain charm that i couldn t find elsewhere the train of thought ramblings the progression of fantasy from simple righteous revenge to things more sinister i have at times found myself reliving things for the sake of altering their outcome in my head if only to make myself feel venerable rather than pathetic or disgusting a reviewer years ago seemed to suggest there are graphic scenes of animal cruelty which causes me to question their understanding of the novel the doggies are very clearly not the four legged man s best friend sort mrs haagstrom would have been happy to see their show i m sure when i cleaned out my fifteen year old car for trade in i found an old beat up cas single of rosco martinez neon moonlight captura me and although i could barely recall the tune decided it had once been worth ordering in the cassette format of the day so i set about obtaining it on cd or download to give it a listen cd was available d l was not when i ordered the cd i thought i was paying for and getting just the two interpretations on the cas single so i was pleasantly surprised to receive a track album of mr martinez music most tracks unknown to me neon moonlight sparked memories and the other songs are representive works of a very good artist i thoroughly enjoyed all there is a sincere passion and longing in this music that is still relevant today its about this kid who thinks the teacher hates him one day on the feild trip people say marvin got suspended what marvin are they talking about bought these for my elementary school they sound great in a very non musically acoustical square cinder block cafeteria so so much better than the garbage speakers they used years prior stars isn t enough to describe this book after reading it i instantly fell in love with it i couldn t stop thinking about it for weeks it s totally indescribable i cried while reading it i don t know why i didn t only cry when people where born died or married i cried when scarlett and rhett fought because i knew they loved each other even if they didn t i m only and everyone laughed at me for reading such a book at such a young age but i don t care it s worth all the teasing in the world just to read that book everything in it was so realistic i truly think the characters must be derived from real people they were so realistic i could write on for pages and pages and i still couldn t describe what a great book this is so i won t even try any longer love the idea of the game but it takes several triess to fully understand all of the rules very enjoyable and competitive once you understand how to actually play it i bought this for my seven year old daughter and it fits the bill a good player without bells and whisles at a great price the straws themselves are great and exactly what i wanted however each package of straws are the same color if you order multiple packages they will put packages of different colors in but there s no way of knowing what you ll get this is a marvelous experience i first saw the jazz singer in in the cinema and was immediately hooked on neil diamond it was gratifying to find a jewish story on the big screen too with shabbat and yom kippur services and hebrew songs juxtaposed with diamond s secular hits looking back after years of life experience and three extended stays in israel i can t help but to have warm memories of this movie the story in my opinion was sufficient to maintain interest and although the acting was either very method and who can forget olivier s eye heff no son how often has that been passed into popular culture such as the simpsons or painfully amateur this film is eminently enjoyable i m very happy with this guide it is very detailed with nice photos it came in good time and in excellent condition a little long to read and it does not stay open by itself but very informative and i am happy that i purchased it for anyone looking to explore the formative years of the australian music industry the distinct crawl style utilising the unique voice of james reyne has become synonomous with the australian lifestyle hot summers the beach barbecues and balmy nights classic tracks include when the boys light up reckless and my favourite hoochie gucci fiorucci mama definately one for the collection to be treasured for just the right moments my month old son just absolutely loves care bears and he loves this toy he carries it everywhere singing with it it is great to hear him try and sing with the toy and dance it cleans up easy as well with just a baby wipe i have been able to clean it up it does get a little annoying hearing it over and over again but he loves it i borrowed this book from a friend and loved it it expressed everything i could never put into words i am going to buy my own copy my classmates in creative writing were just as inspired as i am and are anxious to obtain copies as well can t wait to hear him speak for free at stanford on february rd i enjoyed this book i thought it was a good story about a fallen angel a group not written much about outside of religious texts it also provides an interesting explaination as to how vampires are created kind of hard for the little ones to catch the fish the way the fishing pole is supposed to be used great for older ones thank you china for ending all the fruitless searches sympathetique has removed all our guilt for sitting still and doing nothing also your breathe new life into smoking for all of us who have come to crave life s greatest pleasure vive all french as a second language lyricists melchizedek is one of the most intriguing people in the bible i think because so little is said about him mrs traylor brings him out of the bible and into your home even though this book can stand alone i would recommend that you read it as a sequel to noah isbn one of the things that i admire about mrs traylor is her research and you can tell that she has done a lot of research on him from how well the story flows together this book is also a great lead in to her book abraham isbn but be prepared no matter if you read this book as a stand alone or with the others to be entranced entertained and to enjoy this book and to be saying hhmmmmm a lot i have read this book several times and have enjoyed it each and every time along with always finding new stuff in it for anyone christian or not i would recommend this book this is a good camera but lacking hardware controls for zoom focus and iris the avchd format is good but support for it is still catching up invest in nero or vegas pro to edit this may quite posibly be one of the best books i have ever read i sent a copy to my mother my sis in law my neices and brothers it speaks about the hard things in life that we all have to deal with and about learning to trust god this pack is great i haven t had any issues with it leaking also pretty easy to fill can fill with ice to keep water cold i usually fill about half with ice then fill just below the opening with water great product i was prescribed sepia by an amazing doctor for postpartum depression after traditional medications failed i had severe side effects with every anti depressant i tried i was very skeptical as a rule i tend to be resistant to even strong medications and the idea of a homeopathic working seemed highly unlikely but i tried it as a society i think we re conditioned to expect to feel something when we take a pill with sepia i feel nothing no side effects positive or negative but the depression eases and slips away i keep it around and every so often if i feel a little down i ll take one and it helps i recommend it recentley i had the pleasure of viewing what i believe to be the best animated film in quite awhile titan a e is a marville in its animation storyline and use of twists turns and humor this is the kind of movie that makes you lean back in you seat and smile there are some magical movies out there that give someone goosebumps this is one of them a spectacular adventure about a boy who gets seperated from his father as an alien species attacks the earth the boy grows up but looses all pride in the human race tword the end of the movie he realizes why his father did what he had to do and what he now has to do you will not soon forget this film although some reviews i ve read complain about allen s guitar work i consider it pretty good of course gong s guitar work is much better but if you don t have the single love makes sweet music feelin reelin squealin just like me does anybody know where i cand find it on cd it s perfect the version of jet propelled photographs presented here sung by wyatt is much better than the one presented at shooting at the moon and when i don t want you is pretty good too i have favorite dwarves albums blood guts and pussy are young and good looking and this one they are all you need to complete your dwarves collection some may disagree with me leaving free cocaine out but i dont own it thanks to an online purchase that went splat i ordered it almost a year ago and still no news about it so thats it now back to the subject in question this album is a pretty good dwarves album some classic hardcore punk songs like fu em all fu around speed demon and more dont pay attention to the reviews that said its a bad album dwarves have changed their style many times but anyway this is one of their best cds albums in one and a few hidden surprises dont pass this opportunity buy it now out of the counteless martial arts wannabee movies i think thta this stood out to be in the catagory of karate flicks that people actually enjoy altho flawed some it was still a fairly decent movie as always the stunts are spectacular but everything was fairly predictible my advice is to rent it and see where you will go with this movie from there i was thoroughly entertained by this book and its talented writer the characters are unique and believable this was a suspenseful darkly funny and enjoyable book there were some flaws toward the end but i really enjoyed this one in dealing with difficult teachers education administrator todd whitaker draws upon his many years of professional experience and expertise to provide school superintendents and building principles with non confrontational and guilt free strategies for handling teachers with performance and personality issues this compendium on practical and effective advice addresses teachers who gossip in the teacher s lounge who consistently dismiss any new idea who send excessive numbers of students to the principal s office for disciplinary reasons who undermine administrative efforts toward school improvement as well as those who negatively influence other teaching and student services staff members school dealing with difficult teachers is an essential addition to educational administration reference collections and must reading for anyone charged with supervisory responsibilities for classroom instructors and teaching staff morale having read many novels of this genre i was pleasantly surprised to read what an earl wants by shirley karr the story wasn t exactly a new one but was told with a warmth and attitude that made the characters very endearing i like a book which involves the reader in the development of the characters and this one does just that even as jo quincy is inevitably exposed the book doesn t end there but deals with sinclair s new chemistry with his josephine sinclair s physical issues are also seen through the author s empathetic eyes a good read aside from the famous name dropping which i thought detracted from the book a superb read i still wonder about some of the word play throughout the book and also don t know who played the various positions in the game for example most cats have lives so what does cat velis cat lives mean and all the words beginning with car kar i thought the price was pretty good better than in most stores and it got to me in very good time to begin this is not a gay film if that is your expectation you ll be disappointed this is a film about unrequited love the love for a country and for a man it is a film about federico garcia lorca who loved spain and salvador dali neither the country nor the man was stable enough nor secure enough to accept lorca s love both were at war with themselves both rebuffed lorca both abandoned lorca the man killed a part of lorca s soul the country killed his body the man was a surreal amalgam of self agrandizement and self loathing who never came to terms with lorca and who became a clown in the eyes of the art world the country was schizophrenic but came to espouse lorca s ideals of freedom and acceptance now spain is one of the more open and free societies in the world this film is exquisitely beautiful as is javier beltran in his characterization of lorca this film is his all the reviews on here saying it arrived discharged are unfortunate but it s important to clarify one thing if it arrives discharged in the box amazon will refund you all these reviews make it seem as if you re out if it discharges in the box this is not so i confirmed it with amazon you can t ship it back because of hazmat shipping restrictions it has nothing to do with amazon s refund policy in any case mine came fully charged in the green portion of the arc haven t used it and hope to never have to but it appears to be a quality product at a very reasonable price if you get one discharged you just order a replacement and dispose of the empty container at an appropriate facility if your child is a thumb sucker you need to buy this product our year old was a major sucker and it took only one time yes you read that correct one time of putting clear nail polish to have her stop sucking her thumb she is so proud of herself for stopping and we are too believe me it is totally worth the money now then having to pay for braces further down the road they re very sweet in a way that isn t too adult geared to appeal to kids in this one stella and sam venture alone it s a bit free range which may thrill or terrify you into the woods with sam asking lots of cautious questions and stella offering confident if somewhat inaccurate answers but even in their inaccuracies they re good answers i purchased this as a gift for my sister it is a great gift for someone who loves horses a great way to display a picture of you and your horse well at least one of them is the product details list an airdate for this episode of october this is all kinds of wrong the cage was produced in and was never aired on network television my daughter had these on her wedding registry and i knew she really wanted them she loves them and i was impressed with how sharp they are and the way they feel in your hand a really nice balance this book is fantastic at least for me extremely informative easy to read factual every high school history class should be required to read this book any american should read this book i absolutely love this movie it s one of my favorites of all time mainly because i grew up watching the coreys and i fell in love with them i always had a crush on corey haim so i watched all of their movies what makes this a great movie is the acting of course but also because of the great music played during this film i love the songs and the movie if you love the coreys you will love this movie and if you haven t watched it before what are you waiting for greatest quote why am i running i have a broken leg a novel and fresh approach to explaining the wants wishes desires expectations and behaviour of fictional australian tourists in various parts of the world its as much about travel as the human condition a wonderful book and explains alot about the tourist mentality this particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do i hardly know this pillow is in bed with us and when i do notice it i can t help but to think of how nice and soft it is a great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile the pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position this is a great product and i highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs pregnant belly and face and hands one nice thing i forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side i haven t had any trouble with this pedometer i love it it s very reliable and i d definitely recommend it the chocolate watchband what can you say kindof a psychedelic garage band fusion with a little s soul music thrown in nice the band s range is amazing and the rawness of the recordings keeps it fresh and fun despite the dark undertone of s nihlistic angst which can be felt somewhere in the background try to ignore it frankly i just dicovered this album on amazon so i haven t heard all the songs here but let s talk about girls a minor hit for them expo no way out and are you gonna be there i have on a vinyl collection their album the inner mistique which i have heard all of is also now available on amazon and is beautiful and quite different from this album i am very pleased with the product even ordered on for a family member for them to use in case of emergencies thank you for making this product available and at such a reasonable price what can i say it s mario brothers fun and challenging game mario bros are the greatest i used this on my vacation the days i used it i had complete protection from the sun the day i decided i would go without and try to get a tan i fried to a crisp this stuff has long staying power it does take longer than most to get on it s very thick and a lot goes a long way you really have to rub this stuff in it doesnt stink like a lost of sunscreens do it just smells like regular hand lotion the bottle is great it turns blue when dangerous rays are out highly recommended great for taping tv cable on dvd ram if you don t have tivo love watching one taped program while taping another at same time great for recording in xp or sp mode from minidv camcorder but no firewire i use s video nice to edit out commercials with dvd ram options more limited with dvd r can t take out commercials no compatability problems on older dvd players with dvd r lp mode ok for general viewing later but quality so so sometimes little sound dropouts after you edit but minor player slow to turn on initialize or open disc door i recommend it even with these shortcomings very happy with the product and it was in very good condition when i received it so thank you and i trust you although it may not be his best the cd was still a good ending eminem was one of the biggest rappers to step up to the mic and he always will for those of you pop culture losers that think mockingbird was his best song ever you really should listen to this his best song to me ever was the way i am any way get this album worth tha money my year old loves her pink suede beam very happy the color was amazing and it was good quality my wife home schools her daugther we got this for her school room very sturdy and excellent deal on amazon compared to anywhere else had to send the st one back due to shipping damage packaging could be better but the product and price deserve stars wow this book was really good it s easy to relate to even though you aren t a stripper or even if you don t know one you still hear storys about things they do this book has it all drugs money sex rape jealousy hatred and revenge of course i definitely recommend this book becuase it is one of the best books i ve ever read i used a pad painter today for the first time these things are awesome much easier than using a brush they do load up lots of paint and will lay it down very thick depending on how much pressure you apply my paint time was drastically reduced using this thing and it looks great i have loved the musical cats for as long as i can remember but now i don t have to travel hours to see it i watch this movie all the time and although most of the songs are lip synched that doesn t make it bad i would reccommend this video to any one who loves cats or any musical it s a good one to add to your collection purrs rumpelteazer i really like this album granted it is somewhat differant from the last one but its in a good way loved the last ones but this is awesome i really think everyone should buy it i subscribed to the season unfortunately this is not part of that package this package only includes the holiday specials going backwards in time story is ok the resolution is a bit hokey but probably more in the spirit of the holiday instead of the series i enjoy loreena mckennit s cds and have everyone but the winter one samain night and moon cradle are wonderful songs giving that sense of mystical storytelling huron beltane fire dance is a wonderful song to dance to as well as meditate to annachie gordon is another song such as the bonny swans in which it tells a tale my favorite song of all besides the fire one is standing stones once again it is another storytelling song but she gives it a very ghosty errie feeling that will send chills down your spine i agree that dicken s dublin seems as though it is struggling to work between the childs voice and the music overall this is definately a cd worth having we had one that had gotten the lens error since we had all the acessories already it was easy to get another one camera works great i love this dish i try to keep from microwaving my baby s food so i put really hot water in the base of this bowl it warms my baby s food even food from the fridge and keeps it warm as another reviewer said the dish is very difficult to separate so here s my confession i can t make this work well after reading the glowing reviews of others on how well this works i have to admit that i just haven t figured out the nuances of doing this right i have tried multiple flower types and either they stay too damp or they get brown and yucky i will continue to try but i feel like i m just not getting the timing of the microwave i think it is a great idea and the product is well made and easy to use comparatively so i will soldier on and keep trying if anyone has suggestions or tips send me a comment i m open to all ideas from you successful flower pressers as stated in the title this trasaction was very smooth product came as advertised in a very short time frame would highly recommend this seller to others received cd quickly met quality stated by seller the recordings are clear excellent quality for how long they have been around i recommend this cd for those who enjoy this group because it s a finely crafted gracefully written first novel that showed a whole lot of promise for wickersham back in the mid s maybe the nicest thing about the book is that given a subject matter young love on the rocks that lends itself to sentimentality and a location small town new england that lends itself to preciousness wickersham firmly rejects both tiresome flaws i agree with the reviewer who said that the story upon which this book was based was strong enough on its own but the birthing scene that ends the story has got to be the gutsiest gnarliest most unflinching portrayal of labor ever put down on paper i hope we ll see more of wickersham s work if only so that this novel gets another chance to see the light of day this rotary cutter works great provides nice smooth lines perfect for various types of crafts cloth and paper are ideal the locking blade feature it helpful and seemed to give me more control on fabric projects very large grip is nice for any size nads plenty of extra room over all i think it is well worth a read very enjoyable but for one thing toward the end mared starts to really annoy me through the whole book it seems as if payton begs for her love and she just keeps throwing pushing it away for me the end would have been a bit more solid had she been made to grovel for more then two seconds i know this sounds harsh but i think people will understand once they ve read the book to be honest i hurt for payton so much that at certain points in the book i really believed he deserved better than mared so for me it was a good read but i perfer better balance of power with the two main characters this is the best cell phone case i ve ever used it adds no bulk and the phone is fully functional with it on so you never have to remove it it also costs less than any of other cases i looked at i received my book on the same day i had a lecture it was in good quality and i would certainly purchase from this seller again forever and for always is one of shania s best love songs it has such a nice story line and you can tell the emotion both her and mutt her husband for those of you who don t know put into this single i don t know what dipper watched but it sure as heck wasn t this video because shania s video is absolutely beautiful it has the wonderful background of the new zealand coast gorgeous sunset and sandy beach a nice typical romantic spot for a romantic song for you guys out there if you want to tell your girl that she s special this is the video single to get you can t go wrong with this song this would be well worth it for any shania fan and if you re buying it for someone who s not a shania fan yet they will be after this single i have been following hank azaria since i saw him on stage in an early david stein production of grease he stole the show then and continues to shine in huff now the role of huff calls for an actor with both comedic and dramatic skills very few actors have the skills to shine in both of these areas jack lemmon and the british actor charles chuck pincus come to mind hank azaria is perfect as huff he can make you laugh in one moment and cry in the next oliver platt is simply hysterical as his deeply troubled but highly likeable lawyer great show great cast another feather in azaria s brown and gold cap this was a page turning legal thriller from the very beginning mr patterson manages to weave legal procedures into a gripping story that does not leave the reader neither confused nor bored this was a first time read for me by this author and i was thrilled to find it very entertaining this book had it all suspense romance only a little and very back burner murder trust me pick this book up you won t be able to put it down this will be an author that i will read again the fine craftsmenship of josh rouse is not only an excellent way to come to appreciate this fine singer songwriter but to also take a trip back to a great era of rock n roll from the opening of the title track you can just sense that you are not listening to a run of the mill album of but rather a chance to go back to a time that you may not have been alive for but can totally understand and not feel displaced with appropro backings by the sweathogs and instrumentation that leads you along those winded city streets and into a pool hall or maybe the arms of the one that had it all feel right no worries just good times genuinely without overproduction or loss of sincerity a well worked album that delivers with each listen my wife received her ovarian cancer diagnosis in july the doctors didn t want to tell us too much for fear of overstressing my wife and me and frankly didn t have the time to cover everything one needs to know i ve read books related to this disease since then and this is by far the most helpful it will answer most if not all of the questions you have and preapre you for the research necessary to be active in the treatment of this disease until a more current book is published i would start with this one i also read questions and answers about ovarian cancer it is more of an executive summary and lacks the detail contained in conner langford book give it to a concerned family member who can t handle the pages of frank discussion good book moves along well goes over the information that you would like to see very insightfull would recommend this book to a lot of people as it describes how hard it was for cast coloured men had to cope with a lot of problems in america this is the rd or th of this toy that we have purchased for our lb chocolate lab he loves it even though he s determined to extract the squeaker out of every one he gets we ve performed cosmetic surgery to make each one last as long as possible it s always his favorite toy the only way to make them last longer would be to make them out of chain maille jumbo grunting hedgehog brown the discussion of goals and personal agency beliefs and the tables that acompany them are fresh useful and thought provoking awesome workout with alot of variety this is the first workout tape i ve bought in years i ve worked out at a gym for years and then bought equipment for home i became interested in yoga and pilates over the last year so decided on this tape based on the reviews and i m not at all disappointed the leg work burns to the bone thanks to all of you who suggested it i keep going for it instead of my usual routine i laughed as hard and often as i did when i saw this originally in the theatre it is a great movie both educationally and to tickle the funny bone again and again i couldn t wait to see the sequel and did and was just as pleased and in fact just ordered it on dvd from amazon also these are great and fun movies that also teach kids who watch in a way that they won t even realize they are learning something this book helped me train my child to sleep my baby is months and still wasn t sleeping through the night hardly sleeping through hr stretches the first nights were rough but it s been over weeks and she s sleeping hrs and sleeping better than she ever has this product does what it s intended for though i don t understand what s the use of the cup size button for it doesn t do anything special when you select any of the sizes on the other hand the grind type does help as the machine automatically stops at different timing when one selects either fine or coarse it s an excellent product i got tired of carrying around my franklin covey planner all i wanted was a way to carry around my planner info in a small package the palm zire does just that it is a very basic no frills pda that is designed to be a planner period it does that very well if you want to load additional software you are better off looking at the pricier palms that have expansion card options i love how they don t fall out as easily as earbuds but they re not as big as normal headphones i kinda don t like the asymmetrical wire when i started to do this workout i had just quit smokeing after years i am only so that is a very long time anyway i was not over weight but i was very paranoid that i would gain weight because i would munch on thing instead of having a ciggaret so i went and got this video and started to do it every second day to make a long story short i want to tell you that i never in my whole life had a butt and now i have a nice round high butt thank you patti bauml true this game has plenty of action the sound and graphics are second to none and you ll finish each race swaety and short of breath the only problem is i finished the whole game in one afternoon basically the main part of the game is tournament mode which includes races i finished them with golds st place and silvers there are no game levels or added types of play so once you win the trophy there s really no reason to play again i really recommend this game to rent not to buy for starters learn to spell ridiculous correctly that may give you more credibility or explain why you only rate it a i think it s safe to say that anyone who saw the concerts certainly has the right to give it a rating i ve seen several concerts and the dvd s have yet to let me down if you re a kiss fan you can certainly understand the ratings of a the band is better now with tommy and eric and the concert was awesome plus you get extra footage that you won t get at a concert five is easy although i have not yet seen the product in action i am told my the parents of the children that the year old loves this toy as much as the one year old for whom it was intended that speaks well to me for an interesting push toy having sent many of these types of toddler walking pushing wagons or cars it was really fun to select a product that was different and from a newer manufacturer i m not much of a reviewer i liked this book i love reading john irving s books the way he writes is soulfull i enjoyed this book because i love to read storys of how people live their lives all the twists and turns i truely love to read john irving i hope a new book will come out soon it was exciting seeing sarah do her thing at such a much younger age for the begining of such a terrifying series with the master to contend with it was fun owning the dvd collection the production quality is excellent you ll love it this was a gift to my grandson who saw endeavour fly over this model sits on his desk just the right size thank you i have wanted to read this book for a long time i just never had the time i think it is wonderfully written and given that i did not enjoy the the great gatsby i thought this would be the same i was wrong the pace the content and everything about it is just right definitely recommend warning this is a beginners guide i bought it because it would teach my partner how to get the most from the d it gave a decent explanation of the basic photographic workings like depth of field it did the job better than i ever could because she could rewind and see it again i don t have the patience to do it for the more advanced photographer it is almost useless anyway my partner found the camera too heavy and decided on the d overall good for the uninitiated but for the techies it is old hat i m not a fan of most stuff like this but i purchased blood lust some time ago and was interested enough to want to get the back story being this the first of the series this special edition is i think a little less dark than blood lust and d s demeanor seems a little more lighthearted than in the second this special edition however uses sensual concepts and nudity more than its sequel all around quite enjoyable if you like the premise or genre not a bad addition to any film appreciator s library since i bought damita jo i have neglected my other cd s i ablsolutely love this cd this has become one of my favorite janet album this is her most r b offering to date i have so many favorite songs on this cd and i definitely listen to it from start to finish i do more rewinding than forwarding the cd is well crafted the production is excellent and it just flows well trust me you will love it a solid thriller with willis as the jackal and he is hiring to kill a man gere is the man in prison who knows the jackal s evern move good beginning with the club scene then goes into that famouse scene where the guy gets an axe in the back of the head and then it gets good with willis switching faces and putting beards on by the end we have an assassination attempt a great chase threw the subway and a killer ending willis has never been better gere with a great irish accent poitier always enjoyable if you have ever watched their show on tv this magazine is like a paper version large heavy weight paper pages make this a magazine worth saving great recipes with excellent directions and product reviews that are very helpful first issue came in about weeks and a second followed a week later to get me up to date i will definitely be renewing my subscription for this magazine cook s country maybe not a five star because the scales seem a little cheap but that just makes it more lightweight and im sure it is highly engineered material awesome action sharp out of the box butit is highly unlikely that you will carry this everyday in your front pocket it isn t too big to fit but it is just too darned big get the smaller model if you want concealment i m just saying that it is the largest pocket knife i have ever had and i ended up giving it away as i wanted and every day carrying knife i received my dvd backstreet boys the video hits chapter one it came just as promised online the videos are exactly what the description said i have no problems receiving the above stated item thank you didn t think it was possible to get a machine that can toast and warms cooks and do both well the unit has a slot on the top so if you want to do convetional toast you stick the pieces in the slot and toast away if you want to heat a croissant or a danish then you slide the button to cook the upper slot closes and you can put the item on the oven tray and heat the oven tray is narrow but perfect for heating breakfast type items i cooked a frozen piece of pizza just fine the unit is smaller than a toaster and a toaster oven it does not give the appearance of any great quality but it does work excatly the way you want it its perfect i bought this book several years ago and refer to it often to know which tea would be best for a cold sniffle fatigue menstrual irregularity etc for others and myself it offers a cross index to help you find the perfect tea as a side note i discovered that rose hip tea helps reduce or eliminate hot flashes this was an awesome book and series if you find the bible boring and you think the people were superheroes you ll find this a great read lynn austin brings these characters to life and you find out that they had struggles just like we have and they each struggled in their own personal walk with god lynn austin has certainly done her homework found it difficult to put this one down good day there i have to say when i first played this game on my old psp which was the original when it first came out i was frustrated with the d pad to perform the moves because most of the time it wouldn t recognize the input at times now with my psp slim i have to say this game is great now because the d pad is better able to recognize the special moves and now i don t have to pray on the moves being performed the animation is nice and i have to say the soundtrack is awesome i love the japanese voice overs as well giving the characters some nice personality overall great game this is the third in a series of four books written by charles f price about my ancestors great book as is all his books the price for this essential oil was definitely right it was of thinner consistency than i was expecting but that certainly didn t affect my end product lemon sugar scrub for which i puchased it it smells amazing this music is ageless and this group will blow you away not very many groups know how to make music the way they did and i don t know how anyone can sit still while listening to it one of the songs called she s gone i could listen to all day and i m not exaggerating i just never get tired of hearing it i plan on buying more cd s by this group their music is tight they don t miss a beat weeks certainly has an amazing background in conflict and his book reflects it i found his principles the eight steps to be best applied to long term group conflicts such as contractual disputes between companies or labor vs management strife the eight steps are also helpful for individual conflict but less so as i completed the book i sensed a need to distinguish between the two kinds of conflict and thus devise targeted steps for individual conflict of a short term nature that aside this book is not pop whiz bang fluff it is hardy stuff from an academician with bountiful real world experience in the subject just go buy it it is worth every cent of your money every track will keep your head bouncing thugs honor much love belushi and aykroyd were a great pair to star in this movie i wish they had done other projects like neighbors my vhs tape is getting ragged from being played for so many years who ever owns the rights to this movie need to get up off there butt and get it out on dvd its a shame to leave us out in the cold when they have it available for region players i have no stomach for horror movies but i do love a good spoof this is much different from evil dead or army of darkness where the evil dead things do funny stuff the only funny character in this movie is shaun and the reason he is funny is because he is reacting to being stuck in genuine horror movie brilliantly written this book is pretty old but if your a beginner to both game programming and java then there is no other better book than this it will teach you about classes interfaces inheritance and all the while making it fun and iteresting you ll develope little games along the way and learn about some simple ai too so old and outdated true but worth every penny death in venice is a visually alluring portrait of obsession decay beauty and mortality the dialogue is scarce but i believe the film would not have worked out if otherwise you may or not like it i can not say you will like others have said it is not for everyone but i must say it is for me one of the most beautiful touching films i have ever seen if not the most i found myself entranced in a strange everlasting spell i somehow felt bogarde s emotions and like him i followed andresen through the degenerated streets of venice i adored idolized the feeling of contrast the imagery between the decayed horrific characters bogarde gustav found in venice and the exquisiteness of a fifteen year old boy and you can never ever go wrong with mahler i could watch prince all day this dvd completed my prince collection and now the prince marathon is on the quality is very high great picture and sound spectrum represents the fourth level of a six level course designed for teens and adult learners of english levels and are appropiate for beginners and false beginners levels and are intended for intermediate classes and levels and are intended for advanced learners of english the resonance was extrordinary having lived through the same era roughly the same age as sting sting was able to create a jet stream of his personal drama that i was able to slip into and ride through a life i will never live but felt as if i was as a come lately and erstwhile bass player probably lost in the reality of gigging for pennies the rest of my life i was transfixed by his incredible yet wholly believable journey and transformation from a dime a dozen super talent to pop icon legend in some small way i m sure i have been forever changed by reading his book i thought i was buying this cd for one song step dancing but lo and behold every track is a stunner the winnowing moves one through the emotional scale from joy to sorrow with amazing skill i laughed i cried i danced and i know this will be a favorite forever this is my first serger and i love this brother d serger it is very easy to thread and easy to use the instruction is good and the cd is very informative this was delivered in days would be nice if the cd was also available on dvd for people who doesn t have a computer for a first time serger user you couldn t ask for a easier machine more fun with more games this is a new adventure for me and surely fun for grandkids and grownups we are exploring sports and brain game for now first time wii playing i wish they hadn t made such radical changes in where functions are located and how the toolbars are displayed it apparently never occurs to software engineers that the average customer does not find it amusing to spend hours hunting for needed functions in the first week i came very close to throwing the entire computer out a window in total frustration as a teacher i have very little time and i need my software to work now that said the on line help function is very good you will need it the programs are every bit as good as the older versions of office and documents can be saved to older versions which is also good i have several emails from microsoft explaining all the wonderful new whizbangs that i have not had time to even wonder about i m sure the product is improved and i will be even happier with it once i have an opportunity to figure it all out this was just exactly what i needed for my year old refrigerator good delivery great price keep in mind this is not the sort of pedal you want to use all the time it is not your standby to produce your general distorted guitar sounds this thing is absolutely insane over the top fuzzy velcro like distortion it has a very specific sound and should be used carefully all in all it is one of my favorites the band mogwai swears by this pedal listen to the song rano pano for a good example of how it sounds bought this book for research a lot to read all photos are black and white this book is brilliant it shows through dozens of examples how scientific thinking is superior to magical thinking in writing my book about autism i found it to be common that parents are being caught by pseudo science and not investigating things for themselves i would have loved to have interviewed carl about his comments on this autism phenomena going on right now he would find it quite interesting no doubt it was very clear that sagan cared very much about our planet see cosmos and that would some readers would see as hate of much of the human race is actually a deep caring that supercedes status quo humanitarianism i would recommend this book to the religious right and the radical left jeffrey mcandrewradio broadcaster and author of our brown eyed boy this was an interesting introduction to australian prehistory i d not come across a similar general text on the subject before this one although i ve read some of the data as passing references in other books on prehistory some of the discussion on the flint technology was a little slow going because the differences in technique stone sources and styles among the various periods and regions were less apparent and less engrossing to me than they obviously are to the authors in other respects the book is an excellant starting point for anyone with an interest in austrilia or in prehistoric culture in general i hadn t really heard much about faithless before i got this album but now i just can t get enough it is just so great to find music which you can just put on press repeat and never get tired of hearing it you just float away into your own world guided by smooth melodies funky beats and witty words by maxi jazz it makes you stop and listen to the words and reflect on their meaning from feeling homesick listening to poastcards to having a giggle at she s my baby well i think it s amusing an eclectic soul finding journey which needs to be taken so even if you have never really been into dance although this album can t really be placed in one single category it is well worth getting you ll feel much better definitely gonna have to get their first album now reverence just hope it s as good as this one have fun kathy hannah an avid reader november an educational book expect to read folk tales on why the tortoise s back is cracked how it takes a village to raise a child the differences in hobbies between children in so called third world countries and those in the west educational hand me downs culture as it relates to births deaths and burials then proceed to herman s arrival in philadelphia in fall the culture shock the first winter of a kid from the tropics his summer odd jobs dating in the usa one girl he dated is said to have been a christian by day and a hypocrite by night how this author survived cars in years will amaze you from africa with love is both educational and entertaining where it works it works well in my ranger there are good places to put it and it stays put and is easy to take in and out in my mazda there just isn t a good place for it because the dash slopes towards the driver great story for a quite weekend the narration was awesome definite recommendation the story sets up the lord of the rings and should be read before you venture off into the other books first of all i ll state the obvious just to be clear the mc were one of the greatest and also most criminally underappreciated both then and now bands in rock history they along with the stooges played rock n roll at its most basic and essential and both bands paved the way for punk to come in several years later having said that this is a very good not quite great album i ve docked a star off my rating because of the album s slick but lifeless production quality which lacks the sheer roar and bite of the mc s other albums and a few tracks that should have been left off including two cover tunes but songs like shakin street high school and american ruse are among the band s finest and are tasty slices of period era rock n roll swagger don t make this the first mc album you get but if you ve already got kick out the jams and high time by all means get this ok it is not as good as the original but if you want to have hours of disaster fun this is a nice movie just turn you re brain off and enjoy it really isn t as bad as some say and what a nice medium hd dvd is the picture is stunning with good constast color and sharpness sound is also very nice the extra s on the hd are ok allthough not that many i am not a portuguese speaker and have no idea what the artist is saying but i found the songs fun upbeat and good to swim to underwater mp player they make me happy this is one of my favorite books of all time i throughly enjoyed the intelligent strong female character and her incredibly cute dog the story is paced well and the ending is just what i wanted it to be thanks great wonderful book i highly recommend this is just a simple realistic yet fetching biblical based fairytale there are some period phrasing errors but they never once take away from this moving adaptation of the story of hosea i ve found a new respect for my marriage and for the ideal of and need for forgiveness fairytale or not this story i ve lived and now i can believe it s not a preachy story it is an awakening for redemption salvation and love

loved the actors that were in it and the story line my husband even enjoyed it i bought sonja for my baby granddaughter and she loves it this doll is so soft huggable and easy to hold sonja is the perfectsize for a baby and will also be a favorite of toddlers i m veryimpressed with the quality of this doll and i m sure that she willbe one of my granddaughter s favorites we have a year old reining mare who is benefitting from this product you would think she is a different horse this product has given her added years of riding yere okay im a complete teenybopper but surly that means i know what im talking about when it comes to this stuff right well this is the best cd that you can find sure the best songs are the ones that have been released i want you back god must have spent a little more time on you and my ultimate faves drive myself crazy and tearin up my heart the rest of the songs sound rather different from these but they are still very good nothing on here is like what you find on no strings attached which too is very good and i have to say i like the orriginal n sync best even if you are not in to pop i say you should get this anyway because i find it untrue for anyone to not like it and before i go i have to say n sync are the best i read this many years ago and decided to re read on my kindle if you watched the movie you will be surprised at how much was changed they did that for a reason which is that the book is talk and action which would have made a boring movie instead they made a stupid movie not at all true to heinlein s ook that said the book is a fun read but it could have been so much better most of what we are told in the talk scenes could have come through in action scenes as well the war ends up being a subplot to the ethical and political message not the medium through which we are taught heinlein is a great writer no doubt but read the forever war if you want an sf war story or read early clarke like rendevous with rama or to see how the message and the story can be merged even ender s game makes us think more without preaching at us still a book worth the read always a classic this movie is so funny i have loved it since the first time i saw it and it never gets old buyer beware however this is not a kids movie i thought i d watch it with my year old to make it a fun family tradition and i had forgotten about some of the language maybe in a few years i like this little phone yes the quality of the pictures is poor and it is difficult to see in the daylight you can download free ringers and games at www myhonefiles com once i personalized the phone using this site i was much happier replaced the entire pen because it was the same price as replacing the batteries works fine a fascinating and intelligent thriller for people who are tired of one more book about a serial killer or maniac on the loose people in the computer and business worlds will probably recognize some of their colleagues how nice it is to see real people in a suspense book and not comic book heros i would rate this a out of don t wait for the movie needed a seat to travel with and fold down this one did a great job at that study and very affordable i love this book and although it is not as polished and some reads this story is real and hits home on the emotional front while also taking you on an exciting adventure i liked both the actual book and listing to it on cd i had never heard of the weavers until i watched a recent pbs documentary i immediately got online and bought this one this is a great cd and makes me think how great it must have been back in the day to be happy with simpler things great music instead of so caught up in all the craziness that is our world today there are a few songs rock island line for example that make me turn the volume way up and sing along i couldn t put this book down it was wonderfully naughty in the nicest way i bought it because of susan johnson but was introduced to three authors i hadn t read now i m on a hunt for their backlists from the cover to the final page this one s a keeper i bought this dvd for my nieces and nephews aged they all love it my sisters told me they knew all the songs within a week and sing along with them all the time they even said they don t mind watching with the kids since the dvd s aren t really over the top like so many popular kid s movies tend to be perfect for carrying in my purse which is small surprising how often i use it locks in place while measuring lightweight and other people ask to borrow it all the time this was a great deal the camera package was fantastic the camera takes great pictures this specific pan is the only one of it s kind that i ve found that will work on glass top ranges seeing as that s what i own it was the only option the non stick surface is damaged a little too easily but as long as you use butter every few rounds it works very well it has a nice weight to it for aluminum and the handle seems to be well attached though i haven t had it that long this item makes smaller pancakes than you d expect though fully bite sized overall i m pleased recommend item arrived promptly and i used it on my trip to europe i was very pleased with the curling iron and would recommend to other travelers only disadvantage is that you must have the antenna just right to receive good hd reception i liked the movie because it surprised me at the end this movie is no great work of art or an effort that challenged the acting abilities of the participants it is just something that people who like wesley snipes movies will like unless of course you are a black female black females are not represented at all in the movie as i recall the movie seems more like the fantasy life a black man might have of career and sexual success that for some black men is probably a reality c siegel s book of cross stitch ornaments is adelightful addition to the growing library ofvolumes dedicated to stitchery though someof her designs are rather uninteresting andin general her color choices are bland overall she has created appealing projects in addition she includes step by step instructionsfor finishing projects which i foundinvaluable i recommend this book to thoseinterested in producing attractive holidayornaments i am very pleased with this wine rack it was fairly easy to put together i did it without help from my husband it looks very nice i wish it held a couple more wine glasses but thats no big complaint i m happy with it what a great product and a great deal i can now wax my chin and lip without paying someone every weeks the product is very effective but sticky you need to be careful not to get them on your fingers when i get brave enough i will wax my eyebrows i highly recommend this product my kitchen has a center bar that is difficult for my granddaughters to reach with the step stools they can get themselves up and down which is important when you are the chair reminds me of the one i used at my grandmother s house they took longer than anticipated to put together but are very sturdy and well balanced for some reason that i can t understand mca stopped making this cd i gave my copy to my sister thinking i could get another one because it was always available when i went to order it there are sellers who are selling it but it is no longer being made it is like not having a christmas tree for the holidays every song on here is a great yuletide treat i hope mca will come to their senses and start producing it again it is one wonderful christmas album by the way the andrew sisters make several appearances on here if you have seen a christmas story you will recognize santa claus is coming to town from the soundtrack aya rl is a polish band calma was released in as a follower of nomadeus the tracklisting is calmagon part iv wy toya calmagon part ii elle uti neyo ray vee ameryka dreadman dub lukas part ii calma na na yeah bonus jazz ad ameryka used the weave before and you do have good privacy with less expense than a stockade fence we did the whole front of our property in detroit for less than now that s a savings i ve become addicted to early american history and particularily allan eckert s narratives the frontiersmen is one of one of his best the plus pages fly by as you become engrossed in the struggles of our forefathers to establish safe homes on the frontier however you cannot help but sympathize with the indians as they see their ancestoral lands stripped away as far away governments vied for ever more land eckard s superb use of chapter notes adds clarification for geography buffs who try to place the sites of events and battles a great read at a great price but i did find a slight fault with the quality of this publication created by jesse stuart foundation strangely the front and back covers began to curl up and stay that way i don t know if its just my bad luck a characteristic of large soft cover books or a poor choice of materials in printing process this is a wonderful selection of timeless music and a great addition to any collection i love ray charles and the duets on this cd are absolutly spectacular there is mpeg included on the cd that is a great tribute and remeberence of the late ray charles i have listened to it numerous times since i recieved it in the mail excellent movie unacceptable dvd quality had to return the first dvd the replacement had the same defect as the first returned it for refund decided not to buy any more dvd s from amazon thanks to steyn we get a closer look at one of the most fascinating persons in modern history nelson mandela demonstrates most convincingly that integrity and respect for fellow human beings of all levels is not a sign of weakness but rather the ultimate demonstration of greatness this book ought to be mandatory reading for every person in a leading position be it in the political or any other field thus let us hope that it becomes more readily available outside of south africa great album great remaster signal to noise ratio and dynamic headroom capabilities of the pcm medium are finally realised here exciter invader and better by you are hard rock classics the current generation won t get it but who cares as with all remasters of this sort buy it before it gets gone incredible sound compared to the original cd release and if you like this one get hell bent and british steel you either love her or you hate her i personally enjoy her music i think this second album is much better compared to her first album her vocals are decent and the sound is really crisp she has some great love ballads and the album is great to drive to not anyone can stand amerie so be warned her voice can get kinda annoying at times a little harder than i thought but ok for the price excellent for an extra life jacket a little tight for large man but able to wear it for a short while brian was and still is a total genious there will never be another brian i have enjoyed his music since i was fourteen god bless you brian i didn t expect too much when purchasing this ring because sterling silver immediately turns black when i wear it it was explained that this ring has a rhodium coating and would keep it protected i sleep shower and swim never take it off and it remais as beautiful as the day i recieved it i wear it on my right hand and on my left i wear a real carat t w channel set ring in carat gold i receive more compliments on the sterling cz ring than on the real one i have purchased other cz rings and in time the brilliance of the stones are dulled and there is nothing that can prevent or fix it not so with this ring i reccommend it to anyone that wants a stunning ring without having to pay a high price for the real thing this book is genius every illustration is a window into another world another story each page is a chance to develop the imagination i am a teacher i have already had great stories from my students inspired by van allsburg s incredible drawings i found this to be an excellent book toward getting you thinking twice about yours and others behavior on the road gary mckay is very straightforward about how one small little gesture or incident can end up very costly if this book doesn t make you change the way you drive i don t know what will with very low expectations i rented this film recently and was pleasantly surprised by its maturity and suspense granted jeepers creepers shouldn t be considered a classic but its genuine inspirations come from wonderfully subversive and eclectic sources such as texas chainsaw massacre duel and the hitcher effective camerawork scoring editing and pacing escalate this thriller above the usual garbage and it was so refreshing to see a film not rely on sanitary cgi effects for its shocks overall a good saturday matinee film the kind of which we haven t seen since the early s morningwood nth degreewe are

is one of the best albums i ve ever listened too enjoy the new single if i let you go is the second single from the best pop group in ireland westlife the song is brilliant and has been number one in ireland and all around europe ireland loves westlife i liken the author leif enger to john steinbeck his words are so descriptive that you feel like you re right there watching the story unfold it s a beautiful story written eloquently bought this for my year old grandson s birthday he and his year old brother play together with it all the time their imaginations are unleashed with this toy this movie is a cultural phenomonon a feast of the senses powerful performance by theresa russel she played a wonderful whore convincing breathtaking imagery this movie deserves six stars in i am years old when this cd in i like the album art as soon as i saw juan carlos ure o i new i had to buy it even if i can t find my tuxedo i am mexicano this music book came recommended by our daughter s piano teacher so we ordered it there is exquisite music in this collection best protein powder out there low in carbs and has a great taste recommended for anyone in the market for protein powder i loved this book and have loved everything i have read by tracey bateman i recommend it everyone even those like myself who typically don t like christian romances it is my first levis jeans i am very satisfied with it because it is very fit my body next time i will buy another one this is the first of archer s book that i have read i have a lot of free time on my job and found this book lying around i decided to read it granted there are parts that are boring and parts that could be better researched i really enjoyed this book and will definately look forward to reading more of archer s books i don t understand why this is not yet out on dvd it was so entertaining and the writers and cast did such a great job creating something so funny and watchable the cast were people who you actually cared about what happened to them and to me thats what makes a great story and something that would bring me back again and again to watch episode after episode its a shame its not filmed anymore and an even bigger shame that the dvd has not be released stars komm auf die schaukel jetz geht der hans albers los the hamburger s best known songs are here from auf der reeperbahn nachts un halb eins to ich bin der hans im glueck and in hamburg an der elbe sure some are corny mein gorilla hat ein villa im zoo and others schmaltzy ganz dahinten wo der leuchtturm steht forget the fact that albers doesn t so much sing as he does recite he does it with style and that s all that matters you know all the songs or at least some of them so sing along if you aren t familiar with hans albers or his home city of hamburg there isn t a whole lot to recommend about this cd it is more nostalgic than it is good though it does have a certain charm if you enjoy scene it or trivial pursuit this one s worth the or so that you ll spend many of the reviews say that it was too difficult but i disagree i ve had several groups of people come over to play it got pretty competitive the difficulty level seemed right on the great thing about this game is this even if you re losing you re having a good time laughing at the sketches the bad thing my friends i have enjoyed it so much that we ve run out of new questions i am a game nut i m dying for a nd version of this to come out although unlikely i would shell out big bucks if they d compile another disc step one cut a hole in the box its about a girl who lives on a island and she lost her mom because her mom went inside a whales stomach and the bad guy makes the whale go to the bottom of the oceanand her mom dies nim meats a women named alex rover on the internet by an e mail and they make friends i was very anxious to read favored to win after meeting maryann myers at a book signing in parkersburg wv not being familiar with horses i might have been reluctant to purchase the book had i not met ms myers she is as personable as the characters she creates in this book not only did i learn about horses and what goes on behind the scenes but the book was about believable characters with very exciting interesting storylines if you are a horse lover or just love a great read you ll love this book am adding maryann myers to my list of favorite authors i bought two sets of these legos for my kids which has greatly increased the building opportunities the price is somewhat scary but remember how many you are getting i have always been a ghost rider fan though not like the comic it s just fun for me to see him on screen max cannon is so brilliant i put one of his strips on my mom s computer as a desktop image the one about xerkon invading earth and the kid having to make his appointment at the burn clinic yeah but real life is sicker says the subtitle read cannon don t be a fool this movie was a box office hit and will be a great addition to your home collection it is very well directed and very well casted i bought this after having used on gold standard for the past few years as a change of pace the strawberry milkshake flavor tastes so good i find myself drinking it slower to enjoy the flavor more instead of chugging it like what i ve been doing with other brands of protein the protein content per scoop isnt as high as on gold standard but the extra carbs and cholesterol is better for bulking just what i expected i bought this for my year old nephew and i think he ll enjoy this since he s never had one before i use it for winter runs and it is very warm and comfortable i also have the matching pants the set is fantastic for skiing under your waterproof jacket and pants for the price you can t beat it this is of course a modern version of the count of monte cristo i read this book and loved it and then i attempted the original i quit reading the original after a few chapters the language was out of date and the story was difficult to follow with the orginal character names but this book is great love the straight forward style guardian angel the giftanother fantastic read couldn t put it down i highly recommend this read every person that never understood punk should listen to complete control and white man in hammersmith palais over and over and over until they get it this band wrote the original volumes about any angry young men of insert generation here numerous bands have tried to get the attitude the angst the political savy and political ignorance of an era down on vinyl only the clash really got it right listen to the music and if it doesn t speak to you listen again you might even figure out the lyrics i love the book it is one of those books that teaches you lessons that will stay with you the rest of your life i have been looking for the perfect bag for my new camera i needed one that would hold all my extra lenses batteries and charger manual memory cards cables and had kodak on the label this is it it s very nicely padded inside which is important when traveling amazon s price can t be beat i have seen the commander with and without the lost planet airmen over many years i own most of the titles listed here in amazon but this is by far the most bang for the buck i have introduced many friends to the commander by gifting this cd after more than years of listening to the band this is one of my all time favorite alblums in my music collection this cd captures the band at the zenith of it s artistic arc for a group that has a reputation for great live performances this is the place to start i ve used this product many times with no problems this week valet left my lights on and finally killed my poor battery in addition to just draining it the es had no problem boosting my f back to life that night and a couple dozen times over the next week i m really lazy and did not feel like getting a new battery immediately without once recharging it additionally mine is years old so this company is using quality sla batteries i am the author of this book and find remarks by critics such as the one from delray beach to be amusingly selective his review contains oooh conspiracy putdown remarks but he omits one of the conspirator s remarks years into the plan admitting what they were up to furthermore he omits rhodes scholar strobe talbott s criticism of national sovereignty while saying the case for world government is clinched and he omits rhodes scholar bill clinton s compliment to the world federalist association for giving strobe an award for writing what he did etc etc i would suggest that oooh conspiracy putdowns are no substitute for the many documented quotes in the book i am a huge king koonze cook fan and she is a combination of all three with a new twist i ve now ordered two more of hers great find this one stays with you a bit well worth watching chose it initially because of the star power but the message remained more powerful the somewhat hefty price tag of this newly updated and expanded second edition of this how to guide may limit the slate roof bible understanding installing and restoring the world s finest roof to professional architects constractors and roofers but it definitely a not to be missed specialized reference packed with over three hundred color photos the slate roof bible is the core reference of the slate roof industry covering everything to know about installing restoring and maintaining a slate roof highly recommended i just got my first gps a hand held version garmin in the fall and planned on using it mostly for hiking i needed topo information for the mountains i hike and this software is working very nicely for me i would give it a except that i have found several flaws in the road layouts and it has no trails in the catskill mountains of new york i have used it hiking in the catskills the grand canyon and in the mojave preserve in ca with good results it helps you see where you have been as well as you progress when traveling i also use it considerably more often while driving and other then a handful of roads displayed incorrectly both in new jersey and california it s been great for finding locations and for seeing where i ve been i also ran into a few shortcomings with regards to routing to locations but i don t know if that s an issue of this software or the gps but it sometimes suggests routs that are not possible because the roads don t have an exit or similar errors this is a really good book i recomend it for people who like light reading its a real page turner kept my intrest through the whole book kate white also gives it alot of personality i found it funny and entertaining this is a sweet little movie and i enjoyed it very much that said be warned that this dvd is not in it s original theatrical aspect ratio but in fullscreen format the ratio indicated on the disc is a misprint this is not pan and scanned but apparently an open matte version of the movie not as bad as a pan and scan but still not the original aspect ratio which would have fit in nicely on a tv all the things you hear people complain about wall street today you will see in this book in anecdotes about the market a century ago this book will help you see that nothing on wall street really changes become a better trader with the many pearls of wisdom in this book nat king cole is a favorite artist of mine i loved this cd and would readily suggest it to anyone who love christmas carols his exceptional voice always touch my heart i am more than one hundred percent satisfied with this product fuzzy logic technology is really the right word to represent the performance of this product how delisious cooked rice is thank you for a long tradition of eating rice in japan i couldn t believe it till i recieved it in the mail it apparentlly only comes in yellow but it has hinges instead of just so it should last longer they really should advertise the hinge part they d probly sell more to bad there aren t more color choices a wonderful collection of celtic music that appears to have a greater depth than many of its counterparts the title song is especially and hauntingly beautiful usually i prefer to read fiction but i found myself hooked on this book from the opening pages it concerns the wrongful conviction of ron williamson a former baseball player fallen on hard times for the murder of waitress debbie carter the book gives a great insight into the small oklahoma town of ada where the crime took place and how the local police and district attorney were hell bent on getting a conviction for the murder there is also great detail given to the trial and ron s life on death row but it always stays interesting throughout if this book was fiction i would have found it a great read but as it is factual it makes even more compelling reading probably the best uplifting entertaining movie i ve seen in a long long time love the entire cast and the great music we need more movies like mamma mia will rock is a lot like serious sam great graphics lots of firepower and a high body count the story centers around the hero fighting off resurrected greek gods and demi gods with non magical automatic weapons and rocket launchers and a few exotic weapons you do get magical powerups immortality super slow motion and invulnerability you will need a fairly powerful pc with a good graphics card to fully enjoy will rock also i found this game to be very hard due to the sheer number of enemies that come at you always when you are trying to cross a narrow bridge over a lava pit bosses are always accompanied by their aggressive underlings an advanced degree in fragology is needed to get past the last boss zeus all in all this is a great game for the price and it has no game stopping bugs i bought this disc originally just for the song tom bowling which provides the exquisite cello solo in henry wood s fantasia on british sea songs which features annually in the last night of the proms in london s albert hall and which traditionally invokes much mock emotionalism in the audience the rendering of that song is fortunately fine but the usually beautiful last rose of summer is ruined for me by a setting described in the sleeve notes as an elegaic almost purcellian grandeur now into its second season the first season introduces the characters bringing one into a world of excepted vampires in society with some gratuitous sex scenes and good actors the photography lighting style is straight for an hbo series i do love to watch it develop its heighten interest in vampires lately has actually brought out a fan base that was once not excepted in society the story was well thought out and riveting true suspense in every page i now must read the first book and look forward to the next a great read at the beach a perfect harmony the intertwining lives of animals and humans throughout history by animal expert and author roger a caras is a fascinating informative and enlightening look at how domesticating animals forever changed human history and created the fundamental basis along with agriculture for the rise of human civilization from pastoral livestock to burden bearers to controlled fostered and protected resources for hunters animals have served

adam and the phantom for the creation of this book and for the delight of every fan of sports entertainment i have always had whispy thin hair in an effort to give it enough body to actually have a hair style i have tried every product under the sun in the end the only way i have a hairstyle at all is to color which damages the hair kerastase products are marvelous if pricey the selections offered are particular to any and all hair conditions i just wish it would sometimes go on sale i use this for sitting in a hunting blind i m good size and comfortable for hour long stretches very stylish good quality sound dvd cd player sorround sound system and radio fm am over all a great product classic style looks good not very comfort but they are boots so i can understand not too much to say this was a very good book so many people do not realized just how destructive verbal abuse can be this book was very well written another really good book is this can t be love by patricia goins you won t be able to put it down i love this pan its a little smaller then i was hoping but thats my issue also its heavvyyy but that what makes it great i am going to get the silicon sleve for its handles camila is one of my favorite films it s based on something that actually took place in th century argentina camila was the daughter of a wealthy landowner who fell in love with a young priest she was a very independent woman many thought too independent for that particular time in argentina s history camila and kate hepburn would have understood each other quite well the acting in camila is superb as are the costumes and photography imanol arias who plays the young priest is very handsome and i as a woman understood why camila fell for him the movie deals with the always controversial subject of priestly celibacy extremely well i highly recommend this movie it is a bit difficult to get into at the beginning however if you keep reading it gets very good and you will be amazed at the ending toni morrison is a very talented author just bought this cd a few days ago and i have to say it rocks brandy s voice is pure sweet and breathtaking especially on the songs have you ever one voice and everything i do i do it for you this cd is constantly playing in my cd player i highly reccomend it frank definitely is the truth a very skilled keyboard player as well as a great singer whose adlibs remind me of donny hathaway his second album delivers the goods i keep having when you call my name on repeat but the other songs are great too in fact actions speak louder than words and better off without you are two songs that he gave to brigette mcwilliams for her too much woman album he does a good job with them here but they can t top mcwilliams versions if his first album love stories is better than this one as another reviewer said then i can t wait to check it out because this album is awesome as i saw my dad coming in a cadillac i felt some butterflies in my stomach i couldn t believe that cadillac was ours what i liked about this book were the characters i liked the characters because they really showed their feelings i also liked the car because it is an o k car what i didn t like about this was the white and black people signs i also didn t like how the white cop treated the family when he thought they had stolen the car when they went down south this historical fiction book was written by mildred d taylor i really recommend this book to people who are interested in african american history i have enjoyed the strap but my only complaint is that the fabric used around the neck area is not as comfortable as i thought it would be satisfied like the others the cover showed a newer version had i known i was purchasing the white cover book i would have given stars this is another one of those great s horrors exorcist rosemary s baby that s guaranteed to give you goose bumps i especially liked the apocalyptic themes the prophetic connections to revelations and the historical significance of megiddo and seltzer sure knew how to create a creepy kid i could feel damien s silent staring eyes i could sense his mother katherine s panic and anxiety and i could relate to his father jeremy s desperation the omen is well written full of suspense and darkness i couldn t be sure just from the picture if this item would work to cover my foundation vents correctly so far so good just spray paint to match the foundation and the enclosed springs hold the cover flush against the vent great condition works perfectly a lot of fun to play with friends thank you for this great game at a good cost lenght was excellent for this cable i djed a wedding and this was exactly what i needed awesome buy and good quality for the money this is a great album beck really opens up and shows how mature he really is on this one indeed it s a melancholy album but it doesn t leave you feeling that way if anything it ll help you through feeling like dirt you ll get the feeling beck is pouring his heart out just for you to hear nobody else this album is a narration for a relationship that went bad the bonus track ship in the bottle is really great i m very surprised it wasn t put on the american version because it is just so good to put it frankly go buy this album immediately even if you don t buy the import buy sea change this is a beautiful and valuable book exhaustive and informative the dictionary s subject matter in itself is of course quite lovely there s always a chance that a reference might be missing but for each one that s missing you ll certainly find a dozen others that even your wildest imagination could not place very good game and the seller was very nice and i got the delivery few days after we are very happy this product works like it is described would suggest purchasing the double pack easy to use good price on amazon my older sisters and i used to watch this movie when we were little and we loved it i purchased all three of us this dvd for xmas and it was a big hit it was fun to watch it with my kids as well this was the third how to book i have read and this one really does help the other books i read on this subject were terribly written and the author was just trying to sell stuff from his mail order business not this book the author really explains how to get things going and she presents the information in a well written organized manner i just finished this book and i now know where to start other books are just direct mailers this book really informs you this dvd is fantastic you have to have in your collection keeps michael in our hearts forever a twist of love and european roayality elizabeth is the queen of a heavenly read to take your mind to some juicy details i love this popcorn very fresh all but maybe kernels popped the flavor is awesome i recommend it to anyone that likes popcorn this is a great workout dvd for strength and dance conditioning it is quite a challenge the first few times and left me sore for days which in a workout is a desirable outcome i highly recommend it product works as described and keeps up with its reputation a little goes a long way a proven product lynch college of mount st joseph cincinnati oh does a nice job of describing the role songs played in three depression era strikes gastonia harlan county flint readers unfamiliar with song writers such as aunt molly jackson jim garland and ella may will be delighted by lynch s descriptions of them and their songs scholars will find new insights into the songs and a lengthy bibliography one of lynch s principal points is that unlike their husbands brothers and fathers women lyricists drew an overt connection between the deprivation they saw their families experiencing and the fight for higher wages improved working conditions and collective bargaining rights lynch s prose sparkles and this sets his book apart from so many others published by academic presses i had not listened to a lot of blood sweat and tears until purchasing this album and instantly it became one of my favorites the clarity of these mo fi gold disks is fantastic the horns and percussion just come right out i love it i love this song the quality of enya s music is phenominal compared to some of the music released today the cd is great it has almost a paint like print on it and the version of the song is the video version well worth the money for any collector i really like most of the songs in this movie mostly the ones sung by the two main characters but i really don t like the movie itself i watched the first hour or so but by then it was so boring just get to the end of the movie already ashley tisdale did a pretty good job playing the brat the opposite of her character in the suite life of zack and cody there s not much to the singing abilities of anyone in this movie what s worse is that it doesn t look like they re really singing it at all i don t care if they really sang them or not they obviously try too hard to look like they did this is really all directed at zac efron who seriously opens his mouth way too wide everytime he sings the smallest note it s just weird hard to find item with the footrest but i ve had another for years and is the true beach companion can fit almost anything in the backpack part only downside is that it has some heft to it but that also makes it sturdy not a one season chair go ask alice is a riveting story about a young teen sucked into the deadly wolrld of drugs this story will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next i thought go ask alice was a good book because it tells in a teenagers words how using drugs affects you if you like go ask alice you will also like it happened to nancy well i bought this kit because the fb looks really cool with the big core fighter it requires a little bit of painting to make it look good my only complaint about the kit is that the eyes are to hard to see you can paint them to make them look better but the head hides em a little bit of sanding fixes that this kit goes together really well if you trim and sand the parts right it goes together really tight no trouble with the hands or core fighter it displays really well but its a space suit so it looks better posed in the air if your into that in terms of out of the box building it does really well for the price this is a great kit its loaded with detail the arms hold everything great its well balanced because of the over sized feet they gave the model the feet are to scale they were just big in the show you want to grab this kit also you cant go wrong with the normal gp for the price this is so far best diet product on the market real pure hoodia gordonii ive been using it for a year now love it love it love it after reaching my weight loss goal i am still using it to stay away from junkie helps great hoodoba is my diet product you have to try it to believe it just what i needed perhaps not complete in terms of covering every plant you could want but covers so much more if you re just starting out want more than just the basics then this is your book i m the kind that likes to really know how things work this is the book for people like me if you just want pictures of plants there s plenty of tfh books out there as a tennis player the bolles in the competivision lenses are always a favorite and these didn t disappoint in any way i think quality wise they are a step up from my vigilante s due to the fact that the nose pieces seem to be made a lot better i have had the nose pieces come loose and need to be re glued a couple of times on the vigilantes i got them primarily for my wife and she wears them all the time and loves them great price from amazon although the movie was low budget straight to dvd it s beats out most of the box office stuff most parts of the script came off bigtime what s next funny every character play out well especially the shakila precious characters some of the sets could ve used better lighting like in the club scenes after eric catches his girlfriend in bed with the neighborhood butcher his friend al tries help him out it s worth watching anime checklist boobs check serious heroine check goofy damsel who always gets into trouble check bossy chick with big boobs double check robots of some sort check fan service do you even have to ask check crazy chick that wants to kill serious heroine check over the top villains check under aged and questionable but oddly mature girl check not my preference wardrobes that lack a significant amount of fabric check fan service check swimsuit episode check wild girl serious girl bossy girl and nerdy girl combination check wimpy and annoying guy check welp that s the check list if you like boobs robots and swimsuits you ll enjoy this one i know i did p s if you down rate this review you honestly won t like burst angel when i received it i was very excited when i tried to put the stand on it was to small and broke i called model power and they sent me a new stand free of charge i would highly recommend the model as a fan of the princess of wales i picked up this book because the cover claims to tell what others are afraid to expecting little more than a publisher trying to hawk their wares i have to admit i was surprised at the information and new sources that author nicholas davies brought to secrets lies the book not only claims that the princess was murdered but actually explains in detail the conspracy that led to the fatal and accidental crash in august of i found myself glued to this story and now urge that a more in depth review of diana s death be conducted by an independent investigator i m absolutely amazed this book hasn t gotten more press as it makes the best arguement to date that diana was murdered teeter hang ups is easy i got it because of back pain yes it actually relieves pressure think about it you are upright hours a day fairly easy to assemble and install instructions a la china can be a little more clear product is definitely worth the price any more than i would consider an inversion table a little safer and easier for older folks throwing your feet up and hanging upside down takes a little getting use to but after tries it becomes natural the ability to close the door even while installed is a great design i have the iron gym and all the like don t allow you to close the door because the teeter hang up is readily available i am constantly stretching and hanging off of it very important before you buy any piece of equipment quality is excellent i weigh just over lb s and feel very safe i think it is rated for users lb and under i love this simple dustbuster t does the job much better than the newer more advanced models i don t know why they would change a good thing if you were a fan of the resident evil series on the ps one and you miss it well here it is in minature form its all there down to the really cheesie movie at the begining and awful voice acting this is an exact port from the ps one version with some tweeks which add to its appeal even more if you are as much of a resident evil fan as i was then you must get this game the dual screen is used to perfection no more hunting for the map its on the top screen the action in the bottom one slight gripe is that it might be a bit too small to see everything but this is only minor and you adjust your eyes to compensate for it the ending in classic mode also was not as the original but hell its evil in your pocket buy this game i cant wait until they port re and what a tremendous blessing this book was it is incredible how god used this great women years ago we need would what she had in her life today i remember when marathon came out and the local radio staion started playing hard times good solid rocking there and the band at my high school prom played stand up runnin i too love the instrumental aqua marine generally the album flows quite well although it has a more pop feel than other releases which may turn off some listeners as this book makes clear owl is an exciting development that can make the www very much more useful than it is now even given its current great utility this book is especially recommended for those with information that they wish exposed on the internet it describes how the meaning of the information can be used by inference engines to support web users in finding answers to questions this book is very well written although the topic is very technical the exposition makes it easy to understand i had to write a paper for a history class and grabbed this book as a source from my college library when i got it home i was so impressed i decided i needed it even if i had to buy it new the horror luckily i found it on amazon for something ridiculous less than this is a great book for students or anyone interested in art it has a section with essays by learned individuals regarding art history a section of plates of interesting art and then the bulk of the book is devoted to terms and such related to art history very useful to a student regardless of major if you get a chance get this book it also just makes for interesting browsing this is one of the best books of media and social criticism in recent years unfortunately very little has changed since she wrote it this shows how important groups like fair which works to improve media coverage of women are this is a great tool for cleaning out a mildly dirty spa it is easy to use and easy to handle my only complaint is that the holes are a little too big in the bag and some of the debris slips out but overall a very good value for the money we wanted a theme for our daughter s room that wasn t too girly and all pink and this set is perfect i like that there are additional items available to match the set because bumble bee decor is hard to find we added a little lavender and green to the room to put just a little girly touch my only complaint is the blanket isnt very cozy this book so clearly shows students children the effect the ending has on a story it s great if you re teaching students or your own child how to write stories just reading it gives them perspective and with each of their stories they can write two different endings and choose the better one this book is fantastic get it love is my only master by kathryn peters is a wonderful book it has beautiful written affirmations and spiritual relfections it is truely a star book it helps you through each and every day nothing could prepare the reader for a book like this it has everything warmth humor biting satire irony heartbreak and an insider s look at the mgm studio days fans of every age will read with fascination this can t put down saga of the making of a hollywood star not only did she perform water stunts that at times were truly death defying some while pregnant but her ability to deal with the denizens of the casting couch and studio sleaze reveals a woman as smart as she was talented and beautiful put this at the top of your must read list then pass it on from the first to the last song this cd is wonderful after hearing it being played at a record shop i almost had to fight someone to get the last copy whether you like jazz smooth or hip hop beats you ll dig this cd the mixes are ultra smooth my favorites are bonita applebum great loungin so fresh so clean i get around you got me and crush on you don t hesitate to pick this one up i m definitely getting vol my mom boght me and my brothergot this for christmas he didnt like this toy but i loved it the card installed within minutes and was not a hassle at all to get working and since my di sends a strong signal through out my entire apartment i can have my pcs anywhere and they are still connected at a high speed the card has been running great on my windows pro machine with no problems the software is a nice addition and i can even see me neighbors access point the antenna is removable so that if i do need a better signal i can attach a better antenna on the back answer if you have a di mbps and you are going to get a wireless pci adapter you should definitely get the dwl mbps gget the dwl g mbps if you have a mbps access point the best speeds you can get with the and the are about mbps real throughput with the g and the you will only get mbps at best because mbps will step down to mbps not down to mbps so or but g or g heats the tank really well honestly it heated the tank to well it was getting around degrees but its easily adjusted with a lamp dimmer funny look at death as if it s appropriate anyhoo i ve heard about this show because we don t have showtime i borrowed a friend s copy and liked it too bad that the show s creator left the show for creative reasons he apparently had fought showtime because they wanted the show to be more like touched by an angel happy endings lesson learned etc after bryan fuller left the storyline of george s father being gay was completely changed among other things you ll notice episode when her father hugs the other guy in george s funeral you ll also notice that after episode or so the tone direction of the show changed anyhoo the show is still good funny thumbs up i brought this camera to replace my other powershot i love cannon products so i got this powershot a is i love the mega pixels becuse the other camera i had was only a mega pixels i use this camera alot for my business as i take pictures of interior design work for my clients this camera is light weight and small enough to put in my purse takes great sharp pictures i recommend this canon powershot a is much better than the latter end sg like the old days of richard dean anderson fun action and suspense i don t recommend something easily and i do recommend the stargate atlantis series with high praise this has memorable music including the song with the words the corn is as high as an elephants thigh based in oklahoma farmland it centers around a young man and his girl friend with the complication of another fellow trying to take the pretty young lady away for his own if you love sad happy and shocking books then you will love wringer but if you get quesy easy well maybe this isn t such a good book for you the beginning you my not understand but once you start reading you may not want to put it down i know that i didn t want to put it down this book is sad funny and shocking so that s why i gave it four stars i loved this book and i hope you will too if you want your mojo back this book is a must read the book is well written and packed with inspiring activities and ideas that helped me remember my best self despite the sometimes overwhelming demands of motherhood mojo mom is smart and practical i found the financial planning checklists especially useful right now in coping with the recession i also was struck by the wisdom about the current work culture that is not set up to support moms and what we need to do personally while we re waiting for the world to adapt to the realities of working mothers as well as politically i keep this book by my bedside as a reminder to take care of myself so i can be an effective mother wife friend and professional i am building my knife set right now and i feel that this is a great addition to the set for the price it holds a blade well and is light and versatile i prefer my inch chef s knife for bigger jobs just because it seems more comfortable in my hand i am in school hours days a week i really use my inch for tomatoes garlic and other smaller things i tried cutting chicken with it and there were some issues with the grip and how it sits overall i think it is a perfect addition but definitely does not replace the must have inch i normally wear a d so i purchased this bra in that size i found that the cup size was on the small size i could have used a dd in this one i still wear it and i do love it but wish i had purchased a size larger cup size i love the feeling of the fabric it is a little pricey though i found this book to be a fascinating and interesting read however as to the diaries authenticity it can be anyones guess there are certain facts brought up in the book to authenticate the diary but again everyone loves a conspiracy i won t go as far to say i believe that we now know the true identity of jack the ripper however i will say that it is most entertaining and does give one insight as to how a delusioned mind works the reading can be spellbounding at times the fact remains however that the true identity of the ripper himself is yet to remain a mystery but read the book and decide for yourself it made me appreciate even more what my heart surgeon did for me and made me want to see my kids obtain jobs that truly make a difference in others lives works great looks great i got this for nursing school and cant comment on how sensitive it works because i have nothing to compare it to it works fine so far i will update the review if something goes bad it is a bit sticky which i actually like so it doesn t slide around on the neck this book is fun to read amusing exciting and funny it puts you in the thought of mind hmmm which felonyshould i commit first although the book does give prettydetailed instructions on creating a lot of trouble only apsycho would realy go through with something read in thisbook i totally agree after reading this book i wanted toget a quick start on making pipe bombs and the flame throwerexhaust for my car i even went out and bought the supplies but after a little bit of thinking i was like now what thehell am i really going to accomplish with this stuff a perfect this classic by a w tozer is so powerful that you can t keep it to yourself you do not want someone with whom you are close to miss out on the spiritual gems in this book i am buying several copies to give to my friends tozer s deep spiritual insights cause you to look into the mirror of your heart while filling that same heart with an insatiable hunger for the relationship with god that he so desires for you at half the price as compared to buying it from garmin it is hard to beat my dashboard is contoured and with the wings on this mount it sits just right also the mount is securely attached to the base so there is no suction cup to come loose does not slide with even a sudden stop i wish i would of found this item at this price before i bought my first donut shaped bean bag mount which i use in my other vehicle that has a flat dash this is a great product at a great price this film is a must see for anyone interested not only in foodproduction and food policy in the united states but also what ailes sp us as a nation the us government and the agricultural industryhas unfortunately created a system that is out of whack while we spendless than at any time on food we are spending more and more onhealth care the one point i wish the film had made more directly this film should be seen by all americans i saw another comment thatquiblbed with the particulars in the film the film is not a doctoralthesis it is a piece of art trying to raise awareness i also thoughtthe device of the two filmmakers staking out an acre of corn andfollowing it through the year as a spine to the story was quitewonderful as well as the animations that they did with a still camera as far as i know you can also get the film to screen in your communityfrom the film s website i highly recommend it would be great foodfor thought fast food nation was a wonderful honest view at the effects of fast food it was refreshing to see writing with such candor in it although at times the reading was a bit dull schlosser spiced it up with a few jokes and such hidden and bizarre information it was a wonderful and awe inspiring read memories i loved this era of my life and this was one of the best comedies totally worth bucks your welder on this page is your banner says welder is a amp welder the description of this welder in the body of the descriptions says is a amp welder all company adds show that the is a amp welder however your banner seems to be incorrect you might wish to change it on all the other sites even the campbell hausfeld site shows the as a amp welder on all other sites the is a amp wleder for around the is a amp and sells for persons wishing to purchase this welder will not purchase because of the inaccurate listing it looks like a bad deal however if corrected to amp rather than amp it looks normal bottom line your listing of is correct as your description says but only one word amp in the title is wrong in the midst of all the strange childrens books available these days this one is truly comforting and wholesome it would give a child a sense of security in this crazy world lovely illustrations too i thoroughly enjoyed this novel although not a traditional structured book who cares there are nuggets of wisdom from an accomplished writer and a person who has lived life may not be for everyone though if you are unfamiliar with vonnegut perhaps you should read one of his other stories first great book you can read the other reviews and get the jist of the story but i found it to be a very exciting book with many twists and turns i would highly recommend it for a great summer read i received this book in the shape as discribed it arrived within days from order thank you very much well listening to the jaguares is such a treat from the ballad imaginame to dejate ver and especially the catcy detras de los cerros one can not help but fall in love with this album i haven t heard a whole album by caifanes but if it s like this than i must buy their cds too overall an excellent cd and good buy i ordered two of these for my studio apartment since i have limited floor space i use them to hold a variety of lanterns and electric lights even when they re not holding something their classic design looks good against my white walls in some respects toland s the rising sun mirrors shirer s rise and fall of the third reich the difference is shirer s ability to weave history and storytelling in a seamless work of real brilliance the rising sun is fascinating and comprehensive but didn t pull me in like rise and fall some may not care if a writer of history is a good storyteller but for myself that ability brings history to life it removes the written words from the blank page and creates powerful images focused on some of the most historically relevant events of the past as good as rising sun is the writing didn t grab me it was well written and interesting but not a work i would peg stars on but still an excellent work for anyone interested in the war in the pacific read this book for your true history and heritage read galatians and learn the truth this is not new information this is old lost information read the scottish declaration of independence as they say they crossed the red sea with moses i have an earned masters degree in the bible and a student of history this is the real deal the movie was an alright movie not great but not bad if you are looking for a movie which will pass the time this one will work i like that the setting was in a small italian village most movies are in larger cities with little scenes in villages this was the opposit because it is in a small village the movie moves at a slow pace like you was in a small village not much dialog in the movie which i think hurt the movie some and made it a little slow over all it was an enjoyable movie if you could take the slow pace of it thyroid t really works my endo refuses to help me feel better and keeps refering to my lab tests and says that as long as things are in the normal range that s all that matters but i am still feeling all my hypo symptoms so i decided to take matters into my own hands and after a lot research came across this product my t levels although in the normal range are a little on the low end of the normal range so i bought this and i am telling i have never felt better i already lost lbs in just days a huge deal for hypo patients and i have tremendous energy i am still hoping to have some relief from my fibromyalgia symptoms like the previous poster but the again its only been days so lets see so far i am loving it capital records never cease to surprise me ernie released four great christmas lps but none have been released in its entirity this album has the little drummer boy from his sing we now of christmas album and oh little town of bethlehem from his christmas album the remaining tracks are from his classic the star carol lp that entered charts every year for five years after its release capital records please don t give us a sorry complitation like this release at least one album in its entirity bill gaither and the ford brothers have released a cd set of his christmas songs hopefully amazon will soon be selling online i like this product i ve used it on my slate floors for years yes it does come out milky bubbly it dries clear and smooth don t apply too heavily do several light coats for best results my floors are so shiny after i use this product when i first picked up this book i couldn t put it dowm the story totally captured me as soon as i finished it i wanted to know more the author is a total genis in my opinine read this book you will not be disappointed as i ve been reading through the reviews for this album i think people are being way too harsh this album is not as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be i thought it was a good effort from ashlee i think the songs are quite catchy the best example is l o v e people need to lighten up on her spelling of it in the song and have some fun with it other notable tracks are boyfriend of course beautifully broken and say goodbye i am not unhappy with my decision to purchase this album and i feel that a lot of people are not giving it a chance calphalon is a definate go for mesince i tried this griddle easy to clean and it looks like it going to last for a long time okay whigfield three summed up great dance cd from track one on need i say more this cd rocks and the bonus vcd with all her to date videos as of the release of this cd also rocks great purchase all around dance fans should have no excuses not to own this cd i had many great experience with this camera the touch screen is so easy to use and the picture scan is wonderful i took this camera to huntington library and my pictures came out wonderful the colors are so true and beautiful i took a closed up picture of a pink flower and it came out so clear and nice i very much enjoyed this book and i m sure the movie will not do it justice it was however quite disturbing to consider the possibility that human beings could behave in the manner described throughout the book price was good colors are great got what i wanted and daughter is very happy with them thanks again i read this book just before traveling to scotland the lowlands there isn t much in it about the highlands and found it to be an excellent preparation i was able to recognize the various castles cathedrals abbeys that we saw and knew something about where and how they fit into scottish history i was much better able to enjoy the trip as it wasn t quite so new and overwhelming lang appears not to have too much of an axe to grind but he does have some antipathy to john knox whom he clearly regards as an occasionally dishonest and troublesome rebel who not only upended the established roman catholic church and the monarchy but destroyed a great deal of beautiful art and architecture into the bargain this is a film of a rare quality both funny and having a sexy woman in it heather graham is one fine bird buy this film if not for the laughs then for heather graham woooooooooooooo see it see it tradgedy oh yes that is exactly what to expect wonderfully written and appealing for the time period euripides work is as curious as marvelous this book includes stories of cyclops and greek heroes bound to make readers excited some of the stories are commonly known but most are nt helen and hercules are some of the included tales placed in this book know about ion don t know i suggest you read this book because it is designed to insite the curiosity and engross most readers the stories are all timeless and interesting written by a man that was a genious for his time won t know how good this product is unless we have some kind of radiation problem where ever i happen to be at the time i always carry my iodide with me when i travel the one good thing about this product it doesn t expire until apr this is important steven f hayward has done a top notch job researching and reporting about the birth and gestation of the reagan revolution even though the book describes events that occurred during my adult life i was amazed at how much about that now bygone era i had forgotten thus hayward s history became a fascinating journey into my own past half forgotten past as well as that of the country having volunteered in the jimmy carter reelection campaign much some of this trip down memory lane was as painful as a bruised shin whether one likes or disdains reagan the book is a must for anyone who wishes to understand the unlikely rise of a handsome movie star into a powerful and popular president the book is thick but the writing most definitely isn t well worth the time for anyone interested in politics and modern american history the futurama spaceport magnet has the classic s science fiction look and little touches of satiric humor we have all come to expect and enjoy from matt groening and his crew a must have item for all futurama fans aside from the back flap being curled the book is in great shape just as described it was on time and is a great value every girl i ever dated who smoked used peppermint altoids and they were satisfactorily effective for suppressing all applicable foul odors and a whole lot more great game easy to learn with beautiful women to boot however i wish the extra features were a bit more like dead or alive where you can buy the items you want instead of being rewarded with them other than that this game is great multiplayer fun stars i just got this cd the other day in the store i really did not expect to buy it because it was a week before the release date of course being the toni fan that i am i immediately bought it after listening to the whole thing twice i could not be more happy with what toni is now doing i haven t memorized any of the songs but i know that my favorite is always which is the last track on the cd the set up that a young druid priestess shares a forbidden love with a half breed roman soldier that threatens to destroy both their worlds promises gory battles love scenes triumphs and tragedy marion zimmer bradley delivers all in spades focusing primarily on the females characters she does a great job of arcing the main character eilan from care free child to warrior priestess zimmer bradley gives us an interesting extremely dense story that mixes action magic and romance into a female empowering tale the characters are fairly sympathetic especially when suffering frustrated love pangs and thesub plots are just as intriguing as the main story line though the story sometimes strays too much into female empowerment land thanks to chapters devoted to menstrual blood rites and spell casting forest house presents lots of cliffhangers and surprises much better than its sequel lady of avalon this book s title accurately describes the content and the book does focus on self hypnosis only i bought it because it included the tape but the tape wasn t as much help as i d expected which is the reason i gave it stars the tape uses the muscle by muscle strategy for relaxation which just doesn t work well for me the book is clear gives good affirmations and explains things well the product works well and lifts your bikes up as intended but i have some advice to potential buyers the hooks that lift the bike seat don t securely attach to the seat if you walk under the bikes make sure you don t bang or rock it because it may fall off the hooks they re more like degree brackets than hooks anyway the directions are clear about not standing walking under the bikes while hoisted but these things happen from time to time especially in places like sheds garages where things are stored beneath the included screws are junk and they strip easily do yourself a favor and use proper wood screws consider pre drilling pilot holes and use washers as well the directions are a tad lacking and the pictures aren t the greatest either the misfits is full of humor love triangles and friendships but it actually holds a strong message we all know that middle school years can be tough and a lot of authors write about these situations i believe that this book is going to help me through the next two years because it has taught me how much names can hurt and eventually scar people james howe uses a very creative and unpredictable voice which has taught me a lot about style i would happily read the sequel which is titled totally joe shiflett writes with a complexity and originality that enrich this novel on every page he writes of love faith fidelity and passion with an astute page turning rawness you close this book feeling slightly battered by the chaos and emotional power shiflett commands so authoratively clearly hidden place is the advent of a thrilling new voice in american literature my colander arrived promply and in perfect condition it s actually better than i thought it would be sturdy and perfect for draining pasta ground beef etc the perforations are just the right size so nothing slips out while the water drains well someone commented that the outside shreds her sponges but mine is as smooth on the outside as well as on the inside i m very happy with the price and the purchase this is one of the best firm cardio workouts out there it s only minutes long but it ll have your heart rate up as soon as the warm up is over and it doesn t let up until the end this is pure cardio using the adjustable step i use the transfirmer with it it s a great workout and one i love to do when i m short on time warning it s not for beginners agostino von hassell has captured america it s poor it s sick its rich and famous its soldiers heroes and patriots in a modern day eclectic presentation of what america is in the early st century this book is for all americans to revel in its greatness to appreciate its accomplishments to understand its true fabric and way of life this book belongs in every household it s a wonderful way to reflect on what has passed and what is still to come in what makes this country great i ve read it to my kids so they understand the true meaning of being an american and what their country is all about highly recommended on a honda this mirror is useful only for adhering to an existing cracked or fogged mirror that is still in place if you no longer have a mirror go to your honda dealer and get the entire assembly which includes mounting posts and frame the ad should have made that clear but i also should have known that it wasn t likely to be the right one for me at a third the price now i have a nice flat dorman mirror in my toolbox for looking in tight places ps if you need the honda replacement stretch the springs before pressing it into place so you don t have to push so hard you risk cracking the mirror snow crash is just a wild ride in a high tech world like all good science fiction it allows a historical archetype the samurai to explore a brilliantly created world in this case with his futuristic sword and in pursuit of a harpoon wielding bad guy stephenson is a very creative author and his characters all shine he put a lot of work into this stand alone novel rare for sequel obsessed authors such as him and i was sorry it had to end i picked up snow crash after my favorite author max barry recommended it now i have co favorite authors australian cd maxi single track listing for all i wanna do dannii minogue radio version extended mix trouser enthusiasts toys of desperation mix xenomania dream house mix d bop s innocent girl mix i love this carrier it has latches that closed the container no more pressing the edges all the around great for arthritic hands it is huge and will protect any round cake with several layers even my husband said how easy the carrier is to close really he loves it too i have suffered from menstrual cramps for as long as i can remember just a cup or two of this tea helps reduce the severity and duration of the pain i was doing research on immunity building foods for my four year old son he started daycare last october and every two weeks from then through april of this year he came down with one virus after the other to compound matters he also has mild asthma fish oils were one of the recommendations that i came across so i decided to purchase scott s emulsion for him the week that the product arrived he was in week three of a deep chest congested cough i was using flovent and albuterol as suggested by his pediatrician but as usual they didn t seem to help about little less than a week after giving him the two teaspoon daily which is what they suggest for his age i noticed that the cough wasn t there anymore i ran out of his prescribed meds and so far i haven t refilled them i am so relieved so my plan is to stock up in preparation for the fall and winter season i would recommend this to anyone whose children get sick during the winter season i bought this camera for my husband i thought since i already had a kodak easyshare that i would stick with what i know he took it with him on his fishing trip and he loved using it it makes great pictures the price was right and i feel like i should replace my old camera very soon this is the progressive metal album i ve been waiting for incredible adrenaline pumping speed thrash with complex melodic structures all wrapped up in one tight amazing package i love it this is a must have for any prog metal lover hey does anyone else think that eve of seduction could be like one of the best songs ever you ve gotta hear it wow this is the third watch like this i have owned without doubt it s the best watch value i ve ever had it s a great watch this one with the silver face is much easier to read in dim light that the previous dark faced watch but both are great watched i see where there are complaints about scratching the crystal but a little polishing rouge on a cloth wheel takes out even bad scratches turn your brain off before putting it in the player but if you like silly movies you re probably going to love this one this is definitely one of those movies that assuming you didn t hate it the first time you can watch over and over again personally i laughed myself sick the first second third and yes fourth time the quality of the dvd itself is fine and the usually useless bonus features actually yielded a pretty funny commentary by the actors want to fully realize the potential of your dvd player one of the most awesome quality pictures you will see on your tv because this is a digital to digital transfer think about it produced by computers with no film involved when transfered to dvd looks almost d on a high quality monitor using the s video or component video inputs and it is a good movie to boot for kids and adults alike i have this cd and i think their singing is very mature and i like all the songs on that cd it was worth the money and it is one of the best cd i ve ever listened to the rice diet book helped me to drop pounds eight years ago and keep it off for four years until i got pregnant again and gained extra pounds now that my baby s weaned i can t wait to go back on this diet it s safe and unlike other diets which try to make food more delicious this bland diet helps you distance yourself from the love of food as the author says we already love food too much or we d all be thin really well written and thought provoking a good snippet of information on every page this cushion is therapeutic for me when i use it in a straight backed chair if my back is hurting i can sit in a chair and in a few minutes the pain subsides i use the cushion upside down from what the pictures show thin part down at the seat of the chair and thick part in my back it does nothing for me in an office chair or in a car seat as others have said the cushion will compress over time and lose some of it s effectiveness but for the price i just ordered more of them worth the money but with steves profile gosh he could jam out alot longer you will be singing along with the tunes with a smile on your face i had seen that cartoon network was going to be showing witch hunter robin and since my disgust for dubbed anime is great i decided to simply buy the dvd before ever seeing episodes on the above mentioned network this dvd is excellent i had no idea this series could be so addicting and after watching the first dvd i am extremely hungry for more the animation is some of the best i ve seen in anime and the story is perfectly original i thought that being a witch myself i might be insulted by the hunting that goes on in this dvd but the evil doers in the first dvd are more demon like than witch like i highly suggest buying this dvd just for the mere fact that it rocks with the release of bleach nirvana started a musical revolution which was largely ignored until smells like teen spririt rocketed up the charts in nevermind was to prove the band s defining momement smells like teen spirit sets the standard which the rest of the album follows from the heavy grunge of territorial pissing to the slow almost dirge like something in the way kurt cobain s fantastic lyrics and the band s awesome musical prowess shine through this is arguably the greatest album of all time and which everyone should have heard the album s true greatness is illustrated by the fact tthat neither before nor since has the grunge scene captivated so many people and that this scene died with kurt cobain in believe the hype i already had one from thompson s cigar and needed another one for my second vehicle tired of moving the other one back and forth works great the only reason i didn t give it stars is the plastic might have some defects part of the hinge broke still usable within the first week this book is extremely challenging and rewarding too if you have the patience to stick with it you ll like the outcome the cd is definetely helpful when trying to learn some of the difficult rhythms and chord changes not for beginners this book is filled with every pasta type known to man and then some i am an avid maker of pasta and noodles and i find this book a great resource that i refer to time and time again this truly is a complete book of pasta and noodles rooney is by far one of my favorite bands ever but putting that aside this is an awesome album they have like a s thing going on but in a modern way they re like the beatles the cars weezer phantom planet and a bunch more bands like that all in one this is seriously the best first album of any band i have ever heard they sound great their lyrics make sense are awesome and actually different they write about real things not stupid crap these guys rock and if the only song you ve heard by them is blue side buy the album because every other song is just as good my favorite is losing all control and this is one of the few albums where it gets better each time you listen to it i mean come on who couldn t love a band named after principal rooney from the best movie ever copied from my review of another grand prix ii knife the whole grand prix ii line is fantastic i bought this knife as well as thew sthof grand prix ii inch cook s knifeand i am extremely satisfied the first time i used them i was literally giddy the vegetables i was slicing cutting and chopping didn t stand a chance like a hot knife through butter the knife is excellently balanced and the handle won t slip out of your hand the blade is extremely sharp seriously be careful cleaning this thing i have already destroyed a few sponges and got my fingers a couple times i m used to cleaning dull knives what can i say if you re looking for a great knife to last you a long time you won t regret this purchase i bought this book at suggestion of an instructor to go along with an heirloom machine quilting class that i took it s an amazing book very detailed in instruction and street smart very understandable and you can easily reproduce the styles well with a little practice you ve got to check out the wedding dress inside breathtaking some kidsd think that this card game is just like pokemon but this game is a lot more educational for you have to think of strategy s and you need to make lots of hard decisiouns for example i bought one booster pack for at a japaniese card store and that came with english cards well here you can get a deck of cards for only thats almost as much as a booster pack so these cards also save you a lot more money unlike those pokemon cards also all you need is one deck and you can play so you dont need to buy millions of cards i bought this for my month old son he likes to throw things so i figured this would be a bit safer than throwing things like the remote for the tv he likes the bright colors and can use them indoors and outside the balls are super light they seem to fade when left in the sun a short time overall exactly what i expected for the price i received my book within a couple of days the front cover isn t the same as the one on the website but i don t really care about that the book itself was sort of bland but still a fairly good anthropological read i bought this product over a year ago and still use it almost everyday it takes a little muscle but not like some reviewers are saying it s a great product and allows me to cut prep time sometimes to seconds i have an electic chopper also but tend to use this as there is no setting up to do and it s very easy to clean it s a great little kitchen helper for the price i think this little book has a lot if good usefull info in it i know i learned a lot from it the other boleyn girlthis movie may surprise you if you have been watching the cable television series the tudors it tells quite a different story of king henry the viii and his wives eric bana is very bland and uninteresting as the king except at the moment when he turns his back on mary boleyn and his bastard son then he finally shows some expression scarlet johansson is excellent as mary natalie portman is great as anne boleyn as equal to the task as natalie dormer on the series i have to say the jonathan rhys meyers makes a better henry the viii the way the story plays out is interesting and i will not spoil the ending if you know the story of henry the viii you know what happens to anne boleyn anyway it is a beautifully shot and costumed movie and one worth watching book is worth the price great pictures and informative not difficult to read historians journalists politicians military strategists and novelists have written many books on the vietnam war the green belt is a powerful compelling and original novel written by a vietnamese physician and writer that explores the human impact of the vietnam war especially on the thuong ethnic minority they used to live isolated in the central highlands of vietnam and were discriminated

quiroga m d director program for torture victims los angeles no trespassing is a humane and scholarly look at homelessness its root causes and its grass roots remedies the author has written a non

philosophical and human forces that shape homelessness and offers descriptions of solutions that have worked in today s world its an important read and a good one read it as you curl up in your warm house in a comfortable armchair with a good reading light a cup of hot tea in hand and the knowledge that your chair your light your hot tea will be there for you tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow good read and great ideas i just wish the ending had been a little better it felt very rushed and pulled together other than that i really enjoyed it miss carroll s beauty and brilliance screams out from this cd the best part for me is being able to enjoy her voice with such masterful musicians accompanying her it seems to me that such albums are rare i am so glad that i was able to purchase a copy it is worth so very much more than the few dollars that i paid for it this an excellent work glove sturdy comfortable and waterproof but as has been pointed out in previous posts this is not a glove for extreme cold it does a good job until temperatures drop into the mid to low s at that point my old fingers start complaining anything below that and i m numb within minutes luckily where i live that doesn t happen often for most winter days it is a near perfect glove but if you deal with extreme temperatures on a regular basis look elsewhere i absolutely loved this book i read it in only days this story is terrifying and i could read it over and over and not get tired of it i was afraid that i would have nightmares when i went to sleep i definetly recomend this book to everyone the movie the exorcist the version you ve never seen is also a good movie too it is a mere stylistic issue that keeps me from giving this book five stars parts of this book are too heavy on dialogue a dickens trademark leaving the reader wanting in terms of plot development with that small caveat this book is an exceptional read the ending is one of the most memorable of any book i have read stay with dickens through the slow parts and you will enjoy a literary treasure this is a very sturdy and well constructed it brings a little elegance to the room i am very happy and pleased with my purchase i read this book here in brazil it is available free on internet this book has many chapters talking about the money pumped by famous americans to hitler s gang good work but this book didn t showed you openly that the same banks and companies who gave money to hitler also gave money to lenin or were big ussr s costumers before to example ford motor company gave money to hitler but this happened after big business between ussr and ford motor company in fact before hitler took power in if didn t gave money to hitler s gang you couldn t be a great ussr s costumer it was a good book i liked it other kids would like it i bet i would recomend it to people who like junie b jones i lovejunie b jones books it is a good series open the book to discover an enormous tyrannosaurus rex on a ridiculously small bed with his human father telling him it s time for bed each whimsical illustration tells the story of dinosaurs preparing for bed and asks if they pout stomp their feet or cry at bedtime in the end we learn that dinosaurs don t put up a stink but instead give big hugs and kisses before going to bed the illustrations are fun and the story is sweet with a great message subtly telling children the right way to go to bed it s perfect for any parent who has ever tried to put a stubborn child to sleep i agree worth the price for politics of dancing surprisingly to me the other artists have excellent remix work done for their tracks most which i haven t heard before especially catch me i m falling strut all are worthy of the cd title this is the best of the series treat for the headphones i first read vampire quite a few years ago when it first hit the stands after the first time i read it i read it again soon the book was little more than a mangled mess which remindes me of the movie if there was ever a book turned movie this one is further from the orignal story line than any other one ever done had the movie been true to the book that would have been one bad a movie i have the book for this but went ahead and ordered the cd also it is so fast the print in the book is so small hurts my eyes i am a student and have to look up a lot of words so it is a huge time saver i am a trained linguist but friedman s ingenuity and delight with language far exceeds my own his techniques for uncovering hidden meanings have lent themselves to many a d var torah in my household and the examples alone make the book worth reading the show is absolutely wonderful the stories entertaining and very imaginative what i love is how amazing the animation is and how non verbally expressive each character is there is also a deliberate sparseness to the background visuals allowing the child to focus just on the characters this thing is great awsome detail now for the bad new the instructions are in japanesse witch could be troublesome if you speak english and when transforming the thing you almost feels like your going to break it so dont let people f around with it or it will break but other than that its awsome its about the size of and american football and comes with stand clips no stand and droids gun and alot of extra stickers incase you want to go all pimp my fighter style but if your a fan of robotech and or macross then its worth the to it well run you i tried six other kinds of traps including the basic traps victory traps glue traps etc i think this is by and far the best engineered and most effective trap out there easy to set it s actually reusable with the setting bar on top so you never have to touch trapping bar very low risk of snapping yourself and the bait area is the only sensitive area which is what you want after months of using other traps and watching glue traps get knocked around but not catching anything in them and watching peanut butter bait consistently disappear i nearly gave up but after my first day using these traps i caught one so i had to immediately jump on amazon to review the trap and am happy my place might be rodent free in a few days very very happy with this trap i love this book over verbs fully conjugated the help in my learning spanish has been invaluable my kids love this toy they take karate and this is great practice for their skill of balance and focus rahzel is awesome the first time i saw that all i know video i knew that the video was soo hot you keep it on rahzel peace i like the game i think he is way better then g unit put together i like every song on here and he represented the westcoast perfectly and the beef with g unit he should sqaush that because they aint worth the time and agony cause the game should look forward and not care about g unit and cent you are a p y cause you hide behind the police anyways this album is very good but i do not like on the choruses cause he ruins the songs game you have dr dre behind and that is all you need to make it do not listen to the haters cause this album is way better then any other g unit album virginalthough somewhat of a departure for patterson fans this is one of the more intriguing books i have read in awhile the plot is simple for someone not of a catholic background but a complicated one for those with an understanding of the the workings of the church as always patterson did his homework on this one nora roberts tells essentially the same story three times here a beautiful accomplished strong willed young woman meets a handsome successful determined young man and they clash before discovering that they have the hots for each other it s as simple as that in fact ms roberts does the same in all her books changing the names occupations and locale and she does it better than just about anyone there s always a scene in which they plunder she actually uses that verb a lot i try to imagine it and it always feels a little vague there s plundering in all three stories of this book the real talent is in the creation of the atmosphere nora roberts is really good at that and it shows here as in her other works one can read the books for that alone she takes the reader on a journey and isn t that why we read fiction i give this stars for the sense of place i d give it five stars if the plundering were a little more of a surprise it does come as a surprise when it really comes to the commerciality of u and their music they have truly been known as one of the most dynamic and influential band ever from europe and their music still packs a punch their latest single vertigo is a very hard and upbeat rock song that really is u at their best the song is their first new one since electrical storm from their best of collection the feeling of this is purely fast and hard which is mostly remarkable since u used the song with apple and their itunes commercials nevertheless the song is really very good and if it is this good i can t wait to hear what how to dismantle an atomic bomb is like overall b i ordered four sets of these batteries several months ago they all are working just fine unique this band is not alike many in this masked market as morning jacket destroyers rubies has so such a discrete influences that are almost impossible to perceive with a wonderful voice the voice is interactively and mentally energetic without to appeal watered with artificial tacky beats i know you like comparison ok the faint has nothing to do but both are authentic this matter for me lu ra everyone loves the velveteen rabbit but this gift set is especially nice i bought it for my cousin s new baby and it was very well received the baby is in love with the plush bunny that was included with the set and i m sure she ll enjoy hearing the story again again i recently started sewing again for someone who hasn t really sewn much since the cupcake pillow in the eigth grade this book is invaluable it s has proven to be an excellent resource on how to sew with all different types of fabrics and it even has some great sewing tips sprinkled throughout the book it s given me a little more confidence when sewing and that s just what i needed this is in fact my favorite season of the series because andy whitfield is spartacus sorry liam mcintyre i love this show the writing was wonderfull the costumes the sets the acting and the action and well blood it is incredible and even though andy whitfield is gone he will forever be the first and best spartacus to me if you loved the hbo series rome then you will love this series too which is told from the side of both slave and roman but in reality we all root for the slaves and the rebellion in the end we read the tale of despereaux by kate dicamillo we give the book stars the book is about a tiny mouse named despereaux we knew that he was different when he was born with his eyes open he also has very large ears that lead him to music when he finds the music he meets princess pea she tells him he is cute despereaux falls in love with the princess when his parents find out he is thrown into the dungeon the rest of the story focuses on despereaux s adventures he is determined to find his way back to princess pea one of the strengths of this book is the descriptive language we could make clear pictures in our minds about the way the characters might have looked and also the type of characters they were such as mean and evil or nice and goodhearted we would recommend this book to people of all ages it is an awesome adventure story mrs grizzle s third grade class good story not for everyone though definitely sex oriented of the guy on guy persuasion at times if you are amused by goth culture this book is likely to be at least entertaining to you i can so see people i ve met in each of the groups described constantine s descriptions are very vivid and pleasing to read i bought this for our daughter s trip to poland through her university she hasn t taken the trip yet but she browsed through the book and can t wait for her trip it looks very helpful in finding everything you would want need my mother in law also bought this for their trip to poland a few years back and suggested it to her a definite must buy this is a beautiful horse it really is worth the asking price here the brown horse is beautiful also i have both in my collection and also some of each for sale so yes i think you should buy these horses both of them they re awesome the headphones sound good and they fit well they aren t too tight some thing you have to look out for in headphones fitting over your ears all in all a good deal for the price reading the pretend reviews from the bloody harlot s defenders rev it is clear they are liars who didn t even read the book i give the book only stars because mccarthy was too charitable towards a cult and persecuter of god s people a system of abominable idolatry homosexuality violence bloodshed war and the like cathlolics would be far more honest if they d just admit they follow man and not god s word and that they follow a bunch of italian men a spiritual mafia out of rome bought this for my father for christmas so he could watch streaming sports from espn on our tv instead of the computer screen was surprised by how thick and sturdy the cable is this may be an issue for people needing a flexible cable to go tightly around corners once i d googled to see how to set up our computer to send picture and sound it worked beautifully espn still freezes at times but that s a website issue we ve also enjoyed streaming from netflix with no problems we ve only had it about a month but we re very happy with this product i was really debating whether i should buy cs or this model finally made my mind and got these speakers they really are cool looking and deliver clear sound this book was very moving i read it everywhere i went i just couldn t set it down a great book these were perfect for my boys they are just the right size for my month old and year old they look just like the picture this is one of the greatest and most unique films ever produced in america this drama is an utter tragedy and the tortured tyrone family drama plays out in real time a long dark night of the soul all of the roles are definitively performed hepburn gives the performance of a lifetime full of pain and memories she can hardly bear to recall there is also the remarkably simple but moving piano score of andre previn if you need constant action to be entertained don t subject yourself to long day s journey into night if however you are interested in the depth of the human heart and the catharsis of a shattering tragedy this film will stay with you forever while not ground breaking i enjoyed golf and the spirit by m scott peck the audio was both witty and insightful the author takes us through a imaginary round of golf on the fictional course exotica like many courses exotica has roughs sand traps and water hazzards to sufficiently challenge golfers of all levels dr peck s audio however has less to do with the physical hazzards of golf the book delves more into the spiritual and inner aspects of the game of golf the book uses golf as a methphor for life golf like life has many challenges and success in both requires introspection this film is really more of a comedy than it is a drama which is not surprising given that the heroes are teenage boys trying to stay one step ahead of the blood sucking undead this is not a great film but it is fun if you accept the premise which is what would happen if you discovered there were vampires in the neighborhood besides keifer sutherland has always been a good bad guy ever since stand by me the lost boys is not a chiller and was not intended to be so this is a vampire film that is going to be appropriate for young teens you have to admit there are not many of those around great idea for gifts for boys thru they love gross stuff and here they can learn some things without trying waking up the morning after bush was elected again in the middle of a decidedly red state and home to radical right wing evangelicals al and i were walking the same walk sometimes we presbyterians get caught up in lots of liturgy and passages but the truth is faith is just about loving ourselves and loving each other it s not going every sunday it s living it that s hard i think that s all al was trying to say and i enjoyed the message al will you come to kansas and hang with the band of liberals here we need you tech n ne the way we know him truly lets it all out on this album not since absolute power has tech shined so nicely on the mic face it the tracks bout ta bubble come gangsta and the beast will be tech n ne standards from here on basically if you like rap hip hop and could only get one album this year tech n ne s everready the religion is the one to get download it get the cd it doesn t matter just buy it you ll thank me keep on i love this book i could not put it down beverly jenkins has done it once again i have read all of her books but indigo is my favorite galen is soooooo romantic and caring i could feel all the indigo was feeling for this man if one could be so lucky as to find a man like galen there would be nothing else to want i cannot wait for her next novel short of buying each full operetta this is the best compilation available if only because it features the d oyly carte opera company and chorus great buy this is the best book shel silverstein ever created the poems apply to adults and children alike the book is silly serious meaningful rediculous and extremely well written if you haven t read it i suggest you do i wanted to send flowers but didn t know how to go about picking them out this is a great idea for people that want to make a good impression but don t know anything about flowers i am an amateur photographer with just a few pictures i consider worthy enough to put in my portfolio i purchased this for a total of just under including shipping and received it very promptly though it s probably not a portfolio a professional would use it suits my purposes perfectly it is all black simple and elegant i would be proud to present this portfolio to a photographer to display my work cant say enough good things bout this product it goes on clear smells great and doesn t make your hair look stiff and wind blown only need a small amount to work and last all day i would recommend this product to everybody i will definitely will reorder and tell more people about this product only down side is i think its a bit costly an invaluable resource book for all lovers of yoga meditation spirituality and human potential dispels many common misconceptions about yoga and reveals its true message a great buy i bought this screen on august th i has been working since then not a single dead pixel not a single problem x pixels is awesome i bought dell u one week ago best screen upgrade from the sony dell has x pixels you have to see it to believe it also no dead pixels let s see how long dell monitor lasts one key advise to all owners of heat making electronic equipment install fans on back of item to remove heat will last you many more years this is a good grouch album if you like his others at all then this one is worth having the track with eligh is excellent and one of the standouts as with all of grouch s albums still haven t heard crusader for justice it s quite consistent especially rhyme wise the beats are all pretty dark and somewhat simple not quite as distinctive or memorable as those off his other releases if you ve heard nothing changes it s a lot like that beat wise it s also on the short side if youre just getting into the grouch i d suggest f ck the dumb or don t talk to me which are what i consider his best and a little more accessible this book is small but you can t fault it for that the coverage is thorough the exposition is tight and the use of graphics is restricted to just what is necessary to support the text i particularly liked visualizations like the one on page where the computer keyboard is related to a piano keyboard in a clever and effective form nice going on this one the missing manual books can be inconsistent but this one is great and definitely worth it for the price a must buy for garageband users great great great i have one desing on my front and back doors and now in my bathroomo they look real from even close up a super product and i am very happy now living in a cottagein devon that is filled with glowing stained glass hurrah the only reason i don t give this book an unqualified terrific is that not all of the tactics are truly free the author seems to think that printing and postage are free a better title would be guerrilla marketing for free or low cost but this book should be on every small business owner s list excellent suggestions are made for marketing plans that are within anyone s ability why this song never got more air play i ll never understand the vocals are the best we will ever hear this movie is a thriller if you thought bethovan was bad his evil brother cujo this pooch isn t friendly and will eat you alive if you piss him off go ahead watch this movie to find out you can t help but feel better listening to these talented guys i ve made it known that i want about you to be played at my next wedding or funeral whichever one comes first if you miss the feeling that life is good play this cd and sit back and go on the journey that c k lays out for you in perfect harmony this was an interesting battletech novel i like it because it isn t an inner sphere novel and has nothing well almost nothing to do with the sphere it is only clan verses clan the jade falcons verses the steel vipers i am a wolf clan fan but falcon rising was pretty good when i don t root for the wolves since there are only what novels about them i root for the jade falcons i really like the espionage involved in the scientist caste and all of the grand council politics this made me laugh too if this is your first time reading battletech this wouldn t be a bad one to start off with even though it is a later book in a series you will like it read it it s worth your bucks here s a brother who wrote his own experience concerning the holy spirit though i did not agree with his perspective about the holy spirit i enjoyed every bit of his opinions thoughts one of my disagreements is that the author states that your faith doesn t have to be tested or tried i believe every believer s faith is tested at least every week but as a presbyterian the author and my brother in christ did a wonderful job i strongly believe this book should be part of your christian library i greatly enjoyed chapter the author made me laugh so hard may god continue to inspire more people about the importance of walking after the holy spirit i got mine right on time and the shipping was great there was nothing wrong with the dvd at all oval very happy with this purchase plus great price u save bucks and free shipping win win excellent i didn t get to see it in d i couldn t stand shelly i m glad he got killed i couldn t stand chris either she screamed all the time i liked chili and chuck they just wanted a good time and smoked pot all the time they were funny and cute i liked edna and harold edna was always yelling at harold and harold just nodded his head like okay dear that was cute suspenseful here we have a romance that involves a triangle the man the wife and another woman how will it all end where do our sympathies lie this is a thought provoking story with lots of twists and turns filled with heart wrenching suspense interesting story evelyn horan teacher counselor authorjeannie a texas frontier girl books one three what can i say this guy is a genius and i cant praise his work enough a mix of the x files and the monster from the black lagoon fabulous stuff if you like this and i love it you will also like ancester this item was delivered on a slow boat from china it took weeks but i suspect the usps but the item delivered was exactly as described and fit perfectly and has extended the life of my old hoover brushovac very happy this was a cd purchase for my father who enjoy all the different types of jazz especially this one anita isnt the kind of girl you warm up too however her friends of all kinds keep you busy to only think about her thousands of failings occassional books are in good condition and ready for me to fall into each ending this book is really quite thin as far as historical fiction is concerned much of what takes place really isn t plausible but if you are looking for escapist reading this is it smith has written a great book he s told us why we re unhappy and how to become happier and if that isn t the kind of book that s needed today i don t know what is as smith admits almost everything he says has been said before he s just said it best best or not his writing style is profoundly annoying i thought he had a touch of obsessive compulsive disorder until he admitted later on that as a teacher he s a great believer in repetition at times he seems more concerned that the reader comprehend the structure of his text rather than what he s saying he seems to be trying to make perfectly structured arguments that will hold water with his academic peers i wish he had forgotten those peers and i also wish he had had a less indulgent editor over the entire movie was good ti did a decent job for it to be his st role the other actors pulled their weight as well the movie could have been better but what movie nowadays can t be better at the end of the day atl is enjoyable funny and gives a positive message i like my food really spicy and i was sick of always using up the little red pepper containers i got from the grocery store and how expensive is that so i bought this it s not super spicy if used right out of the canister and cold but i almost always run it through a spice grinder because i ve found that releases the oils better in not just this brand but in all red pepper also if you put it on in something you re cooking the heat will bring the oils out better and spice it up as well i wouldn t recommend this product if you re not going to use it fairly fast i think it ll probably start to lose its flavor and potency after about months if i heard this cd without knowing who it was i would say it sounds like a cross between mudvayne and pantera i disagree with people who think its different from either band as both the mudvayne and pantera styles are obvious i have yet to listen to nothing face so i won t make reference to their style the cd is mostly fast paced with a couple slower songs even the slower songs are good but have a different mood than the rest of the cd the band is appropriately named because the song hellyeah is by far one of the best songs made don t buy this cd if you re expecting pantera or mudvayne buy this cd if you can appreciate both styles blended perfectly into songs not counting in the mood henry kissinger s diplomacy is one of the greatest book of the th centurie but you need to be warned of one thing it is a book which express a point of view and it does very good it is not linked in cientific discurs or anything that resembles neutrality in the ideas so before hailing this book as a bible of diplomacy and international affairs i strongly suggest to read the wilhem g grewe epochs of international law to have a second throught about kissingers book but even with this impetous of trying to convince you that the truth is been spoken this is one of the must have book for everyone especially those who deals in the international area and very usefull explanation about the north american diplomatic psique the product seems to be of as good a quality and workes as well as any i have used previously package contains bass blockers suprised that was not made more clear in decription the in the product model number and description is a little misleading the is microfafrads which translates to hz ohms and hz ohms the wiring diagram is somewhat humerous but it just wires in series with the of speaker so it s no big deal my best friend introduced me to them and i attended a performance at the house of blues in cambridge ma and i was blown away they are a stunning clash of musical types pink floyd radiohead dave matthews they create flowing sounds with haunting honest lyrics they can move a crowd with any song they choose to play cooks even and fast easy clean up if you follow directions and looks great exactly what was advertised on the site we had a larger unit which did not last but seasons the uv light leaked and no longer worked we tried to purchase a replacement light and we were told we needed a new and better setup i convinced my husband to look at amazon and we saw the pond lights the one we purchased was smaller then what we had but it said it could accommodate a much larger pond we took a chance and were so glad we did the light was easily converted to work with our old system our pond is cleaner then i ever remembered and for a quarter of the price we received the uv light so quickly we are very happy and so are the fish and the lilies will look at amazon for our future pond equiptment thanks small matters a year in writing is a great collection of columns and memoirs about growing up and living in southern california the author uses great language to describe his outlook on interesting events a must read that definetly deserves to be read odyssey of the heart is a wonderful book that follows every process of a love relationship from meeting someone to challenges loss of a loved one and the preservation of relationsips over time not your typical self help book it presents a lot of intresting cases short ones to support the different beliefs the author does not impose his point of view he displays the array of beliefs found out there and leaves it up to the reader to take what is valuable each chapter is introduced by a quote relevant to it s content most of these quotes have a strong impact as my favorite people change and forget to tell each other this is the type of book that you don t have to read in order the type of bible book you can go back to time after time to consult it also provides a lot of interesting bibliographical references that are worth checking out a wonderful book to have and count on this book is full of magic and action this book is as all the harry potters all wrapped in one it just doesn t get better than this i bought this for my wife s photography stuff i recently began wearing glasses and i find myself pilfering it for my own use being new to the glasses world any spots dust smudges etc drive me insane er this stuff works better than anything the optometrists office gives away or sells paired with a nice micofiber towel no streaks no problems worth the price to me and momma likes it a lot for her lenses so you photography buffs out there be heartened your smear fix is here i really enjoyed it sara briteman was excelent unfortunetly antonio banderes did not do well trying to sing the phantom of the opera all in all this wasn t to bad i use virus barrier and i d have to say that it is just about perfect it dosn t slow down my computer or cause problems for my computer like some other anti virus software that i ve tried it s really easy to use and i really like the user interface it is glassy sort of like os x i regularly receive automatic updates via the software update feature in virus barrier in fact virus barrier was updated to protect me from the leap a trojan horse before it was even in the news highly recommended one of my all time favorite getz albums for what that s worth very high on the list antigny is very sad like an eligy spring is here is melancholy and wistful but played with an inner peace easy living is warm there we go is the only complex upbeat tune the title track is playful this is the ballad half of the pure getz concert i think this is the much better half despite it s delayed release mostly standards getz meshes well with other players in the band ensemble playing is as close to perfect as it gets with a sense of effortless lightness romantic smoky lyrical blue fog notes good for late night listening lyrical and melancholy these concord albums are rapidly going out of stock buy it while you can excellent recording quality highest recommendation one of stan s best posthumous releases wish i could change rating to stars or more i have a relative with ad we are building and apt for him and his wife this book has been the greatest resource for the contactor and care giver not only does it address medical problems but give suggested solutions and where to get the resource if one were attempting to redue an existing apt house it is very easy to use my local code enforcement officer has been amazed at the way problems can be adressed and still meet codes contractors get to understand more about the needs and how to plan ahead the book helps suggested solutions to many private issues caregivers are reluctant to discuss a must gift to caregivers and counselors organications that provide support and advice this is the best show on tv the battle of the blackwater episode was as good if not better then most blockbusters you will see on the big screen children s ear aches are a nightmare and this remedy is a godsend for parents caring for a screaming baby that is pulling at his ears it contains a combination of homeopathic remedies that help with restlessness irritability fever inflammation congestion in the ears and for throbbing pulsing burning pain in the ears it even includes a remedy for ear pain that is worse at night which isn t that always the case if you are new to homeopathy do not touch the tablets simply tip them over into the lid then tip the lid into the baby s mouth or their drinking water it is also important that they not eat or drink anything besides water for minutes before or after taking the remedy as that can affect it i m the only one is a bit corny but fun nevertheless the rest is mostly outstanding with irresistable music and compelling lyrics her willingness to offend the sexuality police is refreshing and admirable tiny little turtle looks very nice gf never takes it off and it holds up well and look good would buy again given the title of this book complex analysis for mathematics and engineers it is decidedly geared for engineering students and practicing engineers or anyone interested in mathematics too for those who are applied mathematics students or practicing applied mathematicians this book would no doubt be applicable indeed this book is notably readable for the pure mathematician it depends some might enjoy it for its readability this mobile base is easy to assemble as long as you accurately mark and drill the holes for the bolts that attach the corner pieces to the wooden frame assuming you have the inch stock needed to make the side rails on hand you can put the whole thing together in less than an hour and when you re done you have a mobile base that is the equal in ease of use to anything i have seen on the market i especially like the foot operated third wheel that easily engages by simply stepping on the lever mechanism and disengages by lifting up on the lever with your foot nothing could be easier and the base moves smoothly over the floor on three wheels rather than having to lift one side and push your tool on two wheels like an ungainly wheelbarrow so many good characters plot twists abound jessica lang is awesome jessica and lily rabe should get emmy nominations this game might be the best game i have ever played towards the mid of the game you take on a trigger happpy agent whos code name just happens to be snake now of all the r p g games i have played this may be the best but i may suggest if you get near the end i wouldnt play it at night the effects of the messed up part of the game things can get a little creppy i just stopped in the part and i still have chills up my spine the colonol will say the oddest things that almost make it scarry if you buy playstation this is the game to buy the collins atlas of world war ii is by no means comprehensive but it s not meant to be what it is and what it does very well is give an overviews of battles and situtations from the war it does this with a ton of full color maps supported by text and charts the maps to be sure are somewhat small but the book is small it atlas offers itself as a well illustrated overview and it more than keeps the promise the price is extremely enticing fire lash is the th book in the executioner series by don pendleton and the first book in the red dragon trilogy in this book our hero mack bolan takes on the chinese triads bolan starts in san francisco makes his way through the united states and canada and ends up in london tracking down the elements of the triads he must stop the triads illicit operations in drugs sex and other crimes great acting and story of bruce s life and told in a very moving way jason scott lee gives a great performance and a sort of reverence for how bruce lee lived his life the book is awesome it was shipped from amazon llc and took days it did not ship until days after i ordered it not impressed with amazon but the book is awesome great recipes good sized servings and lots of variety i have already lost lbs in wks if people are disappointed with this film because it s not office space they should get over it director mike judge s previous effort was a scathing indictment of corporate america where the workers are dispensible and reports have more value than the psychological well being of the employees extract is a more genial exercise whose laughs are more subtle but not less satisfying judge here seems to be championing family entrepreneurism where the boss has an open door policy and knows the names of his employees this film was dumped on the market during the waning days of summer it s almost like the studio wanted this film to fail the studio may have treated extract like a lost child but don t make the same mistake i was deeply touched by the inspiring contents of this interview prem rawat seems to be a man of great wisdom and yet completely down to earth at the same time i would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to get in touch with their true inner self or would like to find peace within excellent so far i have only begun reading it but it is very good and i know will continue to be based upon the author and his experience highly recommended to any serious strength bodybuilding athlete i got this cd as a mistake from one of the vendors at amazon i was going to send it back but never got around to it so one hot evening in august i came across it again and thought i d give it a spin for giggles was i taken by suprise this is a great piece of work yeah it s full of fluff but it s so much more what a mind picture this produced for me i was taken back in time to a more innocent age with pj s on in front of a glowing fire with a warm feeling of peace in my heart and family past and present all around it took me home to a lot of good places when i got to track it just took off from there not sure where it will take you but i think it s worth the trip don t forget the hot cocoa keep safe and warm peace to all my son and i made this gravy to go over some rice and chicken breasts we don t eat vegetarian but i need to eat gf and we do eat organic this gravy was so simple to make you just add tablespoons to two cups of water and bring to a boil this mix produces the nicest non lumpy tastiest gravy ever the rest of the family had no idea it was vegetarian or gf in fact i had to make more gravy because everyone liked it so much the boxes that come in your order will last a long time servings per box for the price and taste this gravy is a great deal order some today i wondered when i bought this cd if it would be any good much less even close to as good as some of their epic albums like secret treaties tyranny and mutation etc i was pleasantly surprised on both counts i have to rank it as one of their best efforts for two reasons all the songs stand on their own unlike some of the album fodder on earlier releases and the tunes are musical yet still heavy and urgent a mix of qualities that is becoming scarce among the heavy metal bands these days if you like boc you will like this cd if you like melodic hard rock you will undoubtably like it as well note mcconkey you d better pick this one up i enjoyed the picture book dear mr blueberry greatly it describes well how a little girl feels when someone tells her that what she says she saw cannot be real it is a pretty sad book that is made up of letters a little girl emily writes to her teacher mr blueberry about a whale she finds in her pond i will not tell you the conclusion because it is only good when you read the book i reccomend this book to people of all ages even though it is a kids book you can get something out of it every time you read it i kept reading to find out hoe it was going to work it self out i felt like i hadit figured out and then it would take a twist just like all of jodi picoult booksit always keep you interested looking forward to more of her books i got this from amazon for my kindle i am an avid reader and about months ago started looking into the ebooks out there i researched the kindle not sure if it was worth buying seeing i never buy books and only go to the local library because why buy when you can get it for free well after much thinking i decided to purchase a kindle and have found it to be so great i absolutely love love love it i just received it via mail weeks ago and have already read books i can take it everywhere i go and very easy to operate the books you purchase at the kindle store are very reasonably priced too so for me definitely worth buying plus the fact that they download in less than a minute is so convenient no more waiting lists at the library anyone who is questioning getting a kindle do it it is definitely worth every penny thanks i own a person research and consulting firm i was just turned onto maister after years in business man i wish i d read this book sooner first maister s style i like authors who know what they re talking about and who share it with you in an easy to read style check then the content i want take home value maister offers quizes self assessments and checklists that my team and i have used to further drive profitability and performance check next i want to read an author who shares my values that work should be fun rewarding and engaging for employees at all levels check finally the book is backed up with an online archive of articles and insight that maister has developed over his career in the professionals services industry www davidmaister com maister has been a mentor to my young company and we ll be rewarded for our diligence in using his tools and plumbing his insights everest has a great score great narration by academy award winner liam neeson and is an over all great concept it is just unfortunate that anyone reading this will probably be seeing it on a television for the first time everest was made for the imax and has to be seen there to fully appreciate this level of film making it is an eye opening enriching look at this great mountain finally captured in its true essence for the first time for those who can only dream of climbing it red chord is from my hometown boston and i seen them live once before any one knew about them with burnt by the sun but no body belives me anyways when i first heard fused together in revolving doors it blew me away and made me stop listining to bands like between the buried me along with burnt by the sun dillinger escape plan not that i dont listing to them still but nvm just buy it ok its an amazing album with an extra disc that has other bands from difirent record lebals well if you want something that has an revolutionary sound just buy it neverwhere by the ultra talented neil gaiman was my first experience with the author s work i could not be more impressed this is a fantastic tale full of memorable characters some of which could have stepped right out of a charles dicken s novel when everyman or anyman richard mayhew decides to help a hurt young homeless looking girl he embarks on a magical journey into the area known as london below there he meets door and a variety of interesting chracters including rat speakers and a couple of dedicated sadistic assassins the book is part heroic quest part fantasy part satire part mystery but all fun i highly recommend this novel i anxiously look forward to discovering more of the author s work stars no fuss no muss no bother simply wrap the unit around your wrist with the velcro tab push the button and that s all there is to it keeps a record for you and your dr to review couldn t be easier this story proves that behind every good man there is a good woman i will never forget madelyn trying to catch the hen in the hen coop i laughed so hard my own husband thought i was losing my mind armed with everything but the kitchen sink she sets out to prove that she will endure hen pecks and a bruised ego for the love of this man and to prove to him that love does conquer all the values and morals instilled by ms howard prove that physical interaction alone in the modern sense cannot survive without love ms howards uncanny ability to invoke the feelings of the reader make her stories believable i laugh i cry and i even get mad right along with the characters i have read this book twice and plan to let my daughter read it when she comes of age this is a good basic workout for beginners and for those of us who prefer simple straightforward workouts without complex choreography if you re a more advanced stepper you may be bored to tears with this one but for those of us starting out or who haven t worked out in quite some time this fits the bill my only complaint hence out of stars is the low quality of the vhs and sound the music sometimes is too loud and you can t hear denise and denise really needs a microphone she should create a dvd version with better sound quality otherwise once you do this a couple times the sound quality won t be an issue it s a minute aerobic workout followed by some toning all in all a good purchase i actually like denise s personality perky just suits her one of a few places i love to order from i always get things quick and in great condition bought this dvd for my wife and i to use we have yet to use it her fault lol but i have reviewed it and it is great for beginners this could possibly be the best run dmc album ever made you can hear the hunger and freshness in both emcees voices in every song i was yrs old when this record came out and i was hooked immediately no skips needed for this album i can still listen to this album today as if it was still if you re looking for the best football out there this is it it s used by many ncaa programs because of the high quality i found no defects in the leather or the workmanship after reading here and now i wasnt too sure how i would like casting the first stone because here had alittle too much drama for me but this book was really good the characters were realistic except maybe james and the story moved along at a comfortable speed i guess i ll check out thin line and see how it is overall good job ms roby i had an older case logic binder which was great when i needed more storage space i thought i d purchase another case logic the model i had before no longer existed so i went with this one it s a good build and it works well it s not too big as some reviewers suggest the plastic sleeves that hold the cds are cheap even cheaper than the ones that came in my old case logic binder but they seem to get the job done and they re probably equivalent to other sleeves on the market would recommend and or buy another if needed fantastic since his first cross over cd dvd under the desert sky i have awaited another such set i have listened and viewed it many times and it just gets better one of our most prized operatic voices heard today the wonderful artists that appeared on stage and performed with him were outstanding the backdrop of the tuscany countryside was beautiful and well chosen i look for more of these entertaining concerts which i prefer over classic opera the book catholicism now i get it by claire furia smith is an excellent presentation of basic questions in the catholic church concerning beliefs and practices smith does an great job of explaining them or talking things over to contemporary persons in contemporary language she uses her own experiences and modern day references to get at the wisdom of the catholic church and the wisdom of living it out in our times it is a good conversational approach to catholicism for both catholics and those who are not catholic to be able to better get it catholicism in a combination of wisdom practicality and humor well worth reading and hanging on to as a referece a good buy for younger and older pesons for personal reading and for group sharing it s no wonder bleach wasn t quite as succesful as nevermind but this not to say that what we have here is a brilliant rock album and a msut have for any grunge alt rock fans there is no smells like teen spirit here but most of the songs display enough melody to keep taunting you after trhe lsitening experience for some alt rock fans bleach might actaully be more entertaining to listen to compared to nevermind since this is not quite as clean cut or radio friendly produced as nevermind although neil diamond is jewish he loves christmas music this is a great collection for any neil diamond fan also check out his volume christmas album i ve walked for many years and consider myself to be fit i got a pedometer so i could track just how much walking i do i like the omron i got it shows steps aerobic steps kcals and miles walked it works great for most activity but not so good on bike riding where your body moves very differently from when you re walking bottom line is that the pedometer motivates me to walk more that s great this band is great they have this driving rock and roll sound that you just get hooked on they sound like a cross of skid row and the misfits with a few metallisounds in it too i recommend it to anyone whos been looking for that original rock and roll sound that we all thought was dead jordison sounds like sebastian bach and well you will need to hear it for futher info i just bought this cd used last week like i should ve done a long time ago chris cornell s on here i had no idea so that was a very nice surprise as aic soundgarden are my favorite bands of the decade as well as being my rd th favorite bands of all time well if you wanna get technical they tie they both rule i heard got me wrong back in for the clerks soundtrack i think i fell in love i only give it stars just cuz i loved jar of flies first this is just too short plus the th track s annoying as previously said it s supposed to be a joke right cuz i can t keep a straight face so if you thought you had every aic album you don t have this like me get it this movie to my surprise is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time the cast made the comedy drama and romance in this movie work wonderfully together it s definitely a must see very creative and unique book that fosters ingenuity while offering kids a safe place to allow the imagination to go with the flow and have fun listen to the erasmus song it s great i understand the author of the book wrote the song he also sings and plays all the instruments except the drums wow now that s impressive i love this sterilizer i am a breastfeeding mother and use the avent isis to pump milk from time to time this sterilizer fits the isis perfectly along with a few bottles nipples and sealing discs i wash my bottles out after i use them and put them away when i m ready to pump i load this up and minutes later i m good to go you don t need to dry the bottles or pump before using if you use them right away when i m done i wash my pump and store it back in here to dry it stays there until i m ready to use it again i ve never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well it is very time saving rinses easily and works very well i m glad i ve never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove a great introduction to fantasy for younger folks without the overwhelming details e g tolkien that adults may prefer rowling definitely has the magic this is one of my very favorite films when young molly singer s mother dies her father has to find someone to look after her while she s at work so he hires corrina washington whoppi goldberg at the start of the movie molly couldn t talk much because she was too upset about her mother s death but corrina taught her how to communicate some parts were funny like when molly spat milk in her aunt s face some parts were sad like when the grandfather died but i really did get a laugh about the part when molly wanted to go swimming in the pool and corrina said nooo we simply can t my darling we simply can t i m giving this product four stars not because they are great headphones but because they are exactly what i expected they would be they don t fit well or sound great and the cord is kind of short but i spent less than they are a perfect set of throw away headphones good for leaving in your office or backpack i bought this lp when it came out in i still own and possess because one doesn t mean the other this same lp just to see the cover takes me back to being years old up in the attic which was the play area listening to and singing along with this other year old and did he look young for my life memory is filled with music and this slender bright eyed big voice pitch perfect teen had slipped into my tender heart after looking at so many thermometers i decided to get this one cdn proaccurate insta read beverage and frothing thermometer not for frothing milk only to heat it up to make yogurt i have used it about times so far and works without any problems i have to reach the temperature indicated and it might be off by a couple of degrees it has the recalibration tool on the sheath i like the fact that can be attached very secured to the pot with milk and the clip works perfectly stays there without moving my thermometer came without any scratches on the glass surface and arrived very fast it s not perfect but so far still works thank you i listen to acdc all the time even when im doing my homework at school my friend have to yell at me to turn it down frankly i think this album has the best selection of all the cds ive heard including back in black all night long and hells bells but it could of included have a drink on me or big balls alltogether this is the best their is our bunny fit in this basket just right only problem our bunny ate it must say i believe she enjoyed it about a day snack for her i am a male and have a hard time playing the ds for extended periods of time without a set of grips on it this product feels great and makes playing games alot easier for me the speakers are amazingly good much better than i expected they add a fun dimension to the games without having to put a headset on the only problem i have encountered with this product is that it can be hard getting the games in and out with the grips on other than that i highly recommend this product i can t say because i haven t read the whole thing yet i first read a chapter in the new yorker when i was young and it took years to get back to it again its not something to read if you are looking for the romance novel type of sexuality its the kind of thing you ll probably feel guilty about reading maybe but its fascinating and btw a woman did write it it was dominque aury yes the name was fake but no it wasn t a man my dogs got infested with fleas about years ago products which had served well past failed this is the only one which consistently works worth the price double crosses and hidden motives abound as ex cop phil broker tries to find out who murdered his ex wife caren killed as she was coming to him for help nice sense of place upstate minnesota and good characters especially broker and ex partner keith anglund what can i say other that perfect erin and diane really come alive in the movie with a small budget and an up and coming cast kat made a great story come to life the extras on the dvd are worth the price of the dvd grab a copy so kat can make more movies katherine brooks is a great story teller this cd is the best cd i have out of all of mine if your an ice fan u will love this it totally rox way better than any other cds you need this book it is a scream i am biting my nails waiting for revenge gifts sometimes they come back seriously this book is needed on your nightstand so you can laugh yourself to sleep ferris may be short on some of the science but he is a great writer i m a layman and do not pretend to have familiarity with some of the arcana in this book but ferris leaves you with an appreciation of those who do and provides a glimpse of the wonder in their world a mind boggling excursion from the finite to infinite also other science writers take note has a glossary so that if you forget what a parsec is you can flip to the back refresh your memory and continue without leaving great gaps in your comprehension take a commercial break from star trek and learn about the incredible discoveries that are being made today definitely listen to this one in your car on long drives it will make you step on the pedal and cruise if your in a bad mood blast a little saba buy this one in the beginning of johnny tremain s life he burns his right hand silversmithing so in most of the book he can t really use it anymore except to ride a horse his friend rab lets him use his horse goblin goblin is a very rough horse and johnny learns how to ride him very quickly which is amazing because most excellent horse riders can t even ride him so even thought he can t be a silversmith anymore he still is very talented in the book you ll read about many famous people you have probably heard about like paul revere and other famous things that happened like the boston tea party you ll see who was a part of the boston tea party and the group of boys that dressed up like indians and used fake tomahawks to break open the boxes of tea the book is very exciting because you get to see what the revolutionary war was like even if you were just a young boy i think you ll like this book very much pong p chu use a very clear language and goes right in the subject the book explains in details how to develop and understand a good vhdl code it shows the hardware that s going to be synthesized by your vhdl code showing the best practices and the advantages disadvantages of vhdl constructs and the trade offs speed area propagation delay etc i ve used this saw for a couple of years now on the jobsite for both framing and limited trim work it has seen moderate use by several workers it needed no adjustment out of the box and has performed fine for what it is and inverted circular saw fixed to a table it is light and easy to move around it sometimes trips off on overload when i rip much framing material the miter gage is plastic and i ve had to rebuild it once rather than spend bucks for a new one the switch has failed and it was easy enough to get a replacement on line everything else is still functioning properly for the money its a good value and adequate for light to moderate use i love a good murder mystery and silence of the grave doesn t disappoint i bought the paperback in reykjavik airport and just finished it the gripping thread is the domestic violence story it is real and riveting but never so graphic as to be repulsive the other stories in the novel erlendur s own family problems the dogged elinborg and the darkly comic sigurdur oli make this a complex and subtle novel whose conclusions roll out one by one and leave the reader wanting more of these characters and their lives it doesn t hurt to have visited reykjavik but it s not mandatory for the reader to enjoy silence of the grave this is a novel that would make a refreshing television series a clear contrast to the monotony imho of forensic technology shows like csi i only wish they were available to read on my kindle they are not at the moment i loved them i want to read all the rest now too i think this is great the trimmer is light weight and being years old and not as strong as i used to be this is a good thing the battery lasts for a fairly long time and the weed eater really cuts the grass i love it thanks for giving us a product that works as advertised this is a wonderful book twenty games have been turned into lessons with all of the moves analyzed just as with chess for juniors the same author has written a book that is very readable and is clear and easy to understand the games taken from the author s lessons were picked for instructiveness however the games themselves are interesting as i have read in some of the other reviews and fully agree there is an exceptional insight into covering the aspects of chess that an intermediate chess player needs to know in chess for juniors the author provided two games forming the basis for the more games found in unbeatable chess lessons for juniors following this book is more unbeatable chess for juniors i also recommend this author s winning chess tournaments for juniors for an intermediate player a great book that will help any intermediate player grasp many important concepts this is simply a great introduction to bayesian matematics and inference the book starts from the basics and then gradually takes the reader to sophisticated inferencing at all times the author keeps the reader awake by pointing out the key methodological differences between bayesian and frequentist statistics i would recommend reading a basic frequentist text before reading this though not required for learning bayesian stuff but would help to better appreciate the power usefulness and suttle differences that the bayesian perspective offers frankenstein is my favorite movie it s about dr frankenstein who with his servent fritz not igor collect dead bodies from graves and other places then it s only the brain left so henry frankenstein sents fritz to steel a brain from a universety but fritz takes a brain witch was in bad shape merlin as a young man in service to the future king arthur good acting interesting storyline good entertainment stongly advise purchase of the entire set i was swept away with the various concepts and theories that mr berry wrote about although some had a star trek like feel to them i felt that his ideas were very promising and the way that he proposed them were both intrigueing and informative i look forward to reading any of his works with the same enthusiasm i seems to enjoy all things by nancy pearl her interests and mine seem to be at one loving books and hearing about how others enjoy reading is her gig i found this book to be very well written it had many facts and detailed pictures the facts were very clear and interesting the pictures were amazing the pictures were close and very detailed along with capturing the fennec foxes personality i liked the book so much that i told my friends about it and they all bought one to i highly recommend this book in your preparation for the cna exam it is filled with useful examples and its has questions at the end of each chapter to help you be sure that you have a good grasp of the material it is really well written and does not have a lot of just filler text that some of the other books i have seen do they get to the points that you need to pass the test without confusing you with a bunch of non relevant information i ve been listening to sr for years now and their first album is still by far my favorite it is the perfect mix of pop and punk something no other band seems to have gotten right i never get tired of this album my favorite songs being the entertaining politically correct and alive a ballad of strength in the face of physical abuse i can t say enough good things about this cd the only disappointment is that sr s following albums couldn t match its calibur i like the calculator there are a lot of functions to learn i bought it because of the cfa exam some of the reviewers have stated it s nothing like the book thank god having read the book which is fine in and of itself i m glad that the movie was so much better and not a straight adaptation if you wish to order and readthe bookafter seeing the movie go right ahead but expect a few very dry and yawning bedtime reads that might bore you the special edition of this film is the one to get i already owned the original theatrical release but re purchased it because i had to see the two documentaries that were included on disk two i usually frown at studios double dipping to rake in more cash from an unsuspecting audience but in this case it was well worth it this is a much over looked movie that was superb in every way the next time the phone rings and no one responds back you ll immediatly think that it s the mothman whether you admit it or not not only did i receive the book very quickly the seller personally made sure i had gotten it thanks for the great work i am very pleased because there is no leaking with this shaker a few shakes and you have a delicious cocktail my favorite is the bloody mary in terms of style leakage and size i am more than happy very little need to clean up as well give it a quick rinse and you re set since i ve been a huge kansas fan for several years it wasn t hard deciding on whether to buy this cd or not but it blew me away how good this live cd actually is they really run the gamut on this by doing material from the older days and a lot of newer stuff too it s also a double cd so there s plenty of room for the greatest prog rock band of all time to cut loose and of course you can t have a kansas live cd without one of the greatest songs of all time carry on my wayward son closing it out also if you re interested there s a awesome dvd that accompanies the cd that kicks too a stooges fan it was great that this collection has cone at last going to collect the whole set i do feel sorry for the families of the stooges as i have heard they are not fairly compensated for all the great work that was done by the three stooges mundy a native of birr co offaly is a singer songwriter much similar to fellow irishman paddy casey his influences include bob dylan jellylegs is very good for a debut while not really fulfilling his potential some truly classics songs include gin tonic sky life s a cinch and to you i bestow featured on romeo juliet soundtrack waiting eagerly and patiently for album buy it this is a high quality changing pad cover i have to different styles of changing pads and it fits both completely it is very soft and it has slits for the safety straps which most do not i ordered covers from jcpenny and they did not even come close to this cover sent them back and ordered and extra of this one teaches more than most college intro economics courses while providing a clear history of the monetary systems of the world will make you think about money and the free market from a totally new perspective simple enough for most beginners and a relatively fun read about sound money and why our current system is not sustainable a great r rated comedy with a few suprizes along the way great cameo by chevy chase and loaded with laughs from start to end some of the funniest things groucho ever said were not all on the silver screen this collection of some of groucho s best shows as host of you bet your life are priceless i watch them over and over again so i can feel how it is to laugh at humor and not bodily functions made in poor taste like comedy tends to be now worth every penny and not easy to find in a regular video store my sister in law recommended this book to me ages ago and i purchased it the day i found out i was pregnant and have been reading faithfully ever since it provides clear information and good advice i m only weeks but have used it as a reference for all of our questions thus far this is a great dvd worth the money just for the amazing grace track but the buyer should be aware that only the video was recorded at the coliseum the music and voices were recorded elsewhere the result is that there is a perceived disconnect between the visual and the audio the tone of the voices doesn t match what it would sound like if recorded live and the lips don t synch very well with the sung words it is a little disconcerting but one gets used to it i found this movie to be a very heartwarming christmas story the actors in it worked well together genie francis and ted mcginley and the message within the story was one of hope and love of family it makes a great addition to my movie library i ve had this dvd for or years and its one i keep coming back to if it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect which is why it only gets instead of stars from me as it is a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want the exercises are solid and tamilee really knows her stuff definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library it was really funny particia arquette and joseph gordan levitt are wonderful it had a great story good acting over all it was cool rated pg for language adult situations and brief nudity great cd set have listened to it with our great grand daughter and she loves it good quality brand new set received quickly this is a classic book that i have always loved and now can read on my kindle glad to see it free then this is the magazine for you focuses pretty heavily on the desert scene which is great if that s what you re into some x stuff too plus gear reviews event coverage and tech articles this long black nylon button up rain slicker with lining is cheap packable and looks good fit is true to size and quality is better than i expected this is a great raincoat and of course keeps the rain off very well i picked this up on a recent vacation to minnapolis and found i couldn t put it down i do think the book does omit some key cult writers but the ones who are included are handled by writers who obviously know their subjects this guide includes a lot of my favorite writers jonathan coe italo calvino jasper fforde borges etc and i was pleased to find out some things about their lives and work that i didn t know before the guide points out the writers essential works and suggests what a particular writer might have in common with another writer the book is often funny without being mean spirited definitely the best we heard from memphis bleek at the height of the roc a fella reign with the exception of maybe or songs a good listen from start to finish this book like the others i have read from the business review series is top notch it covers the topics presented in college level economics courses it covers macroeconomics and microeconomics theories easily this is one of the more readable texts on an otherwise dry subject the book targets both students and professionals who want to get a deeper understanding of economics recommended general franks really did a good job on this book its deep real and thought provoking to say the least to me this book has really brought to life the meaning of service to god and county honor and strength i am buying two more copies for my sons who both serve in the military i want them to know the view from a real soldiers eyes as seen by him give it a read you will at least really enjoy it if not be moved deeply although these cookies have grams of sugar per serving cookies the tart lemon flavor is predominant they are much lower in calories than other sweets my only complaint is that it takes some will power to have just of these little pieces of heaven the pencil sharpener was a hit for my grand daughters class the teacher said it is quiet and a much needed item for her class love it if you are a christian and a believer you will know there is hope and a wonderful place to go when you die it gives you hope of the life after death and also makes you decide where you want to end up and there is a hell i would perfer to be with christ i never got to watch this movie as a teen but now i can watch it over and over love my vamps along with everyone else these pants were alot bigger then i expected not a big deal my problem is that the treestand pattern is different then my long sleeve these are overall a god set of pants i was sure when i picked up this book that it would push me back toward those years in the s when we all seemed to think that vegetarianism was the logical answer just about everything that was wrong with the world so i was surprised that eric schlosser wasn t really pushing that philosophy he s not truly anti hamburger he s just in favor of healthy hamburger healthy for everyone cowboys consumers corporations and even the cows one effect of those who read fast food nation will probably be a severe lessening in how mindlessly they turn into mcdonald s or burger king when hunger hits on the interstate instead you just might find yourself looking for kosher and organic meats and packing your own lunches before heading off on a trip to disneyland a much needed book this book was an absolute classic dickens and twain were the geniuses of dry humor and this book is no exception my only concern is that this material may be mis applied to the present and may heighten in some readers a sense of wealth envy what with dicken s rather unflattering characterization of the rich readers must read dickens with a full understanding of the time in which he lived and not draw too many parallels to our society today which parallels i would opine are as frequently mis placed as otherwise note i apologize if there are any glaring errors above i am trying to type this from my kindle gustbuster classic inch automatic golf umbrellathe gusterbuster umbrella is the best umbrella i have owned thus far in my life it is a very good quality umbrella and the design is sophisticated and appealing this umbrella is the official umbrella of the pga tour it is well worth your money if you would like an umbrella that can withstand strong winds while retaining style authentic styling and voices cole porter as written and played on broadway it s a look into the past that is still relevant i m happy i have it older comics tend to be heavy on the campiness and light on the plot and character development ok so this essential spidey collection isn t really any different but it does manage to elevate itself above the heap despite the fact peter parker s got a lot of spunk and personality and lee isn t afraid to use it lots of silly one liners and the overall coolness of spider man he is one of the neater superheroes out there make this collection entertaining to read or to put it another way i found reading through the essential avengers a chore dry dull stuff but essential spider man was truly a pleasure highly recommended these attachments are great it makes my peet dryer that much better cause i can dry multiple things all with the same dryer it makes it a much more functional and efficient product this unit will clean up all your nose and ear hair problems it will bring tears to your eyes but the result lasts longer then sissors in fact i am due for another trim worked better i thought it would this book was extremely informative and gives you a sufficient education on the movement the practices the past and the future of rastafarianism its a sure read for a well written cultural study i did my research before purchasing these headphones they certainly have great sound and good bass i was a bit disappointed in the bass as i like to listen to dubstep very low deep bass much of the time however they do have good bass compared to many others i m not so sure i will find headphones designed for that type of music otherwise i have nothing negative to say the reviews are pretty on point they do sort of make your ears warm and they are a bit tight to my head so after wearing them for a long period my ears need a break they definately cancel out noise others will not be able to hear what your listening too i hope this helps those of you in search of good headphones i would recommend these to someone seeking good over the ear headphones this book hits you between the eyes it is not a salve to make wounds feel better it will get you in the gut and often particularly if you are already wounded looking for a magical answer you will feel worse than better it will probe your darkest thoughts of god and yet if you are ready for some reality real balance in the quest of healing crabb will get you working it took me two reads to find some hope with this book i highly reccomend following this one up with abba s child by brendon manning it is the balance to the work of finding spiritual health answers for the broken i found the content of this book very useful and enjoyed the authors use of historical anecdotes to reinforce his point his constant bashing of strip mall karatekas and harping about real combat and bone crushing blows should have been a little more aggressively edited his point is sound but gets tiring after the first chapter and doesn t quit until the last page as an ex bouncer and bartender i have encountered plenty of tough guys fights ambushes and general mayhem and the authors words have the ring of authenticity to them the technical content was useful and to the point all in all this is an excellent reference albeit with a less than optimal signal to noise ratio my daughter who is going on loved this video and her favorite creatures are sea turtles i also showed this video to my students who are mentally handicapped adults and they liked this video as well so if you want a sea turtle video for kids this is this is the one to get i guess based on one reader s comments that some think that travel is just about the photos you bring home or a big adventures to boast about my friend gave me this book to help prepare for a trip to south america i m taking this spring it s the most adventurous thing i ve ever done and this book really is helping me let go of fear and open my heart thanks beth for giving me this book i saw these guys open for the locust in la a few years back and they rocked i got every record they had that night you should too go vegan good characterization and fairly accurate descriptions of the time period the nuances of medieval marriages as a political tool is well documented i purchased these and charged them all two at a time with my newly acquired sony super quick charger model bcg he featuring voltage and temperature monitoring functions which by the way recommends only using sony brand aa and aaa ni mh batteries yeah right i guess i m just a dc rebel and they all took a charge without a problem i m for no dead cells was this review helpful to you her remake of gloria gaynor s disco hit into a soul gem is a stroke of genius and one of many highlights here tight production great sound quality and a fair share of variety make this a good cd turned away all night all day and in the red are my favorite cuts and they all sparkle with a mid to late s commercial soul sheen but there is also a bit too much filler to make this a true soul classic the title track makes this worth owning this is what a remake should really be what were they thinking when they created this game it is probably the worst rpg ever you start off in a snowball fight and you have to have specific rules to fight what why can t you just fight normally the battles are horrible and that s pretty much all you do in the game you have to follow specific rules and all you do is move around and get into position and attack it is boring watching the monsters move around and the snowball fight takes about minutes no fight should take that long in the start of a rpg this has horrible gameplay and is no fun but a die hard fan of final fantasy who likes rpgs might like it but i don t even count this as a rpg it is a disgrace to rpgs everywhere this kit works great we have made three batches so far and if you follow the directions it comes out great this show is amazing and the main characters have similaraties to mulder and scully from the x files release it have been using this non stop at work letting my caffeine addiction grow this is a great way for a single cup and is pretty forgiving but makes a great tasting cup of coffee i knew before buying this album that this was different than a typical flashy sting album and was not disappointed the music and text are soothing though he whispers at various points in the album and it is a bit difficult to pick up on the words the instrumentals are smooth and any fan of sting will be suitably impressed that he is just as good on the lute as he is on the electric guitar this is a collection of the best of frank zappa or more accurately the most commercial music from a decidedly non commercial performer zappa s only real hit was valley girl although don t eat the yellow snow and dancin fool managed to achieve moderate success all of these songs could be classified as novelty songs which would probably tend to be the most accesible type of music zappa recorded almost all of the songs here have at least some humour to them other than the instrumetals naturally some may complain that this cd doesn t explore a wide enough range of zappa s music but it is a good introduction to his music for the uninitiated i find it thoroughly enjoyable i bought this just to make mashed potatoes and it s terrific for that it s easy to use and easy to clean i ve been waiting for this album to be released for so long it s finally here and it was all that i could have hoped for for those long time evanescence fans you will be awed once again this album has several new songs while others that were released in limited edition some have been remixed and give it even greater depth my immortal is such a great song along with many others of the like evanescence has had some greater background pieces some more piano and more strings i love this cd and would strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something more than the dime a dozen rock of today amy has such a powerful and wonderful voice and ben s lyrics are just so awesome the songs evoke such emotion and most people can connect with the messages in each song go evanescene hope to see you more and more i needed robes for a harry potter party and these worked great they aren t fancy by any means but they were economical to buy a bunch the hood is connected by small velcros i ended up sewing the hoods on so they wouldn t get lost this book sheds light articulately and in great detail on a man who has behaved so strangely and used rhetoric in such a destructive way for so long after reading his book you will understand his sheeplike followers but at the same time feel sorry for a man with such great yet squandered potential who comes off like his followers as strangely naive and spoiled professor chomsky has done so much damage to this world and to america and it s important to understand how a man like this thinks and how he was able to create a movement based on lies about the very country that has adopted him and his family made him wealthy and famous and allows him the very freedoms he uses to try to damage it with this book succeeds in that endeavor an excellent book but lacks the depth of musil the exuberance of joyce and the obssessive dissection of detail that is uniquely proust still worth a read first off i haven t heard anything like this in a very long time although you can hear a little mix of enigma and delerium on track magna canta still has their originality the chants are melodic masterpieces and do everything to make the listener competely satisfied i highly recommend this cd to anyone who listens to enigma delerium mythos amethystium and so on i own this dvd if you are a fan of this group i suggest you buy this dvd cd package right away to add to your collection you ll be very happy you did i m almost speechless after seeing the bridge it truly affected me so much so i replayed the entire movie a second time immediately as a bay area native the folklore is long over this man made expanse and i even remotely know someone who took the leap the editing is superb and the interviewees are left to tell their stories without the intrusion of an interviewer the impact palpable with one exception for me the soundtrack was almost another character itself it wasn t until i did a little research afterward that i found out that all of the footage was shot during by the film maker i figured there may have always been cameras perched around the bridge in hopes of intervening with the jumpers while the subject matter may upset many viewers i found this to be one of the most compelling documentaries i have ever seen and i m a docu junkie i plan to buy it after buying his previous cassette lie to me i had to have another jonny lang this happened several years ago but i have recently upgraded my music to cds and this cd was a must have i found his voice had mellowed just a bit since lie to me but the raw emotion seemed even more intense if you love blues this album will satisfy lavender by virginia mcnaughton is a great book for the person who desires to study the botany of lavender plants with its very detailed botanical explanations of every variety of lavender this book might be perhaps too scientific for a casual fan of the lavender plant however lavender farmers and those wishing to know more of the science behind the plants will find this book extremely helpful i bought the kindle edition of this book golden dawn however the format of the table of contents compared to the paperback edition is different sad to say even the knowledge lectures are not the same it s lacking in the kindle edition please help me with this this items comes in a very nice compact package of very useful items can be used with several items and applications if you have a pile of unsorted papers this is the tool for you i have at times fifty or more papers that need to be sorted last name first just try to do this making or more little piles then place them in order with this simple folder you just go through your piles place each paper in its alpahbetical order then remove them each tab has a little window you can look through to make sure you haven t left documents in the sorter the name of this item is daily desk file sorter i suggest amazon change the title of this item ordered two pairs for my husband and they fit perfect exactly as advertised with the elastic at the ankles sine i love good coffee this percolator does the job i broke the glass top of my old coffee percolator and i lucked up on this one i am really glad i did it serves me well name me nobody is original and real the characters are textured and all of them flawed some are drawn with great depth and dimension emi lou von kyle whilst some are less clear sterling babes grandma still the story will keep you hooked until the very last page name me nobody explores the troubles of self perception sexuality broken homes bullying and finally adolescent relationships the protagonist is a likeable but imperfect narrator who will charm your heart some parts were so emotionally fraught that they forced me to examine the pains and pleasures of my own life you will ache for emi lou when those she once cherished turn against her a brilliant story leaving aside the tv show tie in nature of this album this soundtrack stands up nicely as a concept album with female artists covering classic tunes relating to love and domestic life a glance over the list of artists will suggest the soundtrack will be somewhat uneven and that s borne out by a through listening shedaisy doesn t really have the chops of martina mcbride liz phair or the indigo girls and the latter don t even seem to be trying particularly hard some artists like phair or gloria estefan try and put their own spin on things while others do a more note for note classic rendition it s typically those trying to make the song their own who succeed the best and there are enough such performances to make this album work fun stuff although it s a shame more of it never made it onto the actual tv show a recommended purchase for fans of liz phair gloria estefan or martina mcbride i loved this book so much because it was exciting and thrilling when the family has to go up to the mountians to look after the overlook hotel for the winter danny has visions that things are going to go wrong he has visions that there will be murder blood and death when he starts yelling redrum that is the most thrilling part of the book read on to learn how this great and scary book ends curtis stigers self titled cd i love this cd i had the cassette but no way to trasfer to a cd i was so happy to find this cd great music great songs and great singer i would recommend to all curtis stigers fans this is definitely the best book i ve ever read about advertising and the advertising agency business no try to set rules that don t exist no try to build up philosophies that don t work but a clear and timely vision of how to stay ahead in the business if i would build up an agency today this would be my ideal of how it should act and work to everyone working in advertsing buy copies one for yourself one for your boss one for your client to every client of an agency if only you would read it to jon and richard if you need a creative send an e mail in a new kind of telescope using subtle quantum effects allows for a detailed examination of all the planets of the galaxy and abroad life is present everywhere but not civilization subtle evidences show that civilizations are numerous but that they disappeared where what is our own enthralling future this book is anticipation in the jules vernes style bold but realistic prospects with nowaday science some scientific popularization without forgetting warm hearted characters in an optimistic vision of life richard trigaux author great little cooking set for children from about and up our kiddos are from to and they love it although there s a lot of information the equations could be physically correct in si system right now there are many strange numbers and conversion included i e or etc which make the practical calculations simple but hides the underlaying physical principles i have the third edition which i purchased for self study after i ran into trouble in kolmogorov and fomin introductory real analysis which i had purchased after i ran into trouble with the topology and real analysis assumed by o neill in elementary differential geometry the advantages of lay s book are described very well in the editorial reviews above the book is very clear in both layout and prose the author anticipates questions and explains the reasons for strategems used in proofs the logical connections among such concepts as open and closed complete compact continuity metric spaces and topology are presented clearly i am enjoying lay s book and i anticipate that i will soon be resuming study in differential geometry i ve listened to the rolling stones for some time and have to admit i like it once you start listening those songs stick inside your head it doesn t have all their songs but that is okay the cd is still good to listen to if you are a die hard fan of the rolling stones you might have to wait for a case of all their hits like they have done with led zeppelin etech was very prompt in the delivery of my memory cards i would recommend them highly thanks this is not a perfect game the main flaw is that it is a short game some would say the other flaws are that the solo game is meh and that the game is too easy this is probably coming from year old men kids will love this it is light and very fun the action puzzles aren t too hard to figure out the game actually lets you play with two players at once throughout the entire game this is perfect for siblings not unlike lego star wars for two players mr fantastic is by far more fun to play but playing as frozone ain t to shabby bottom line if you are looking for a fast paced great two player game this is it buy it now the practices in this book are solid chia is extremely knowledgeable if this comes across as new age to some it is because chia is trying to make this material accessible to many people if you want to gain experience of qi gong healing this is an excellent entry level sourcebook the voice the hair the face lift the diva is back this album could be easily mistaken as a stock aitken waterman project and surely will make donna summer green with envy although most of the tracks in this album sound similar from one to another but cher s energy saves the day apart from everybody s favorite title track strong enough and the next single dov e amore should get to your attention the latin beat of dov e amore reminds me of gina g s ti a mo a couple years back by the way both songs were written and produced by the boys at metro pop this cd into your car and enjoy the ride well produced videos with amazing subject matter nova has done some beautiful work here for those of you whose faith will not allow them to accept evolution you should still quite enjoy the other three you may even enjoy the drama of the disc on darwin it s a wonderful story love this eggs cook evenly and peel very easily i am ordering another for my husband to keep at work for what it s worth one interesting thing about this book is that the essay by mr x has been positively attributed to the luminant carl sagan by grinspoon himself sagan discusses his experiences with mj and provides persuasive and convincing accounts of his experiences very interesting i bought this movie because i had heard about it for years and never seen it i live in south florida and had heard from old timers about it i ve even seen pictures of the gentleman that built the boat used in the movie it was quite different watching gary cooper in florida vs texas or somewhere out west i enjoyed it even though the effects were dated and you re far more used to seeing the actors fighting bloodthirsty indians in western scenes vs swamps several scenes brought a chuckle like the rubber gator attack but all in all it was a great watch i found this book a little hard to get into axia and jamie were just too annoying in the first few chapters chapters in i was finally a bit interested i found it hard to believe that axia would sleep with jamie at the very beginning even though she found him shallow the last few twists at the end were a little bit too convenient everything just seemed to fall into place too easily this is my second book of jude deveraux and i ve got a lot more on the bookshelf hopefully they will be a little bit better its neurotic its hypnotizing its amazing listening it on the headphone at night lifts you to a higher ground a departure from this world its provactive sad and joyful hard to do but its done all in this album i ve never written a review before but i love grace and the nocturnals music so much i couldn t resist this is the kind of music you never get tired of will be in your collection for the rest of your life the music rhythm lyrics all of it is superb i have been designing hardware and programing the series for over years still the book makes a good cookbook for methods and ideas that i may not have used for years and have forgotten for hackers it is great for serious designers it puts all in one place an outline of the cpu hardware architecture various option configurations and firmware suggestions i like it and i am keeping it in easy reach on my bookshelf after reading some of the reviews here i decided there was not a good cheap alternative so i bought one anyway i have not had any problems whatsoever with the unit it works perfectly every time i saw fareed and goran in concert recently and it was my first exposure to their classical jazz guitar blend within one minute of the first piece they played i was absolutely in awe the pair works together perfectly and this cd is no exception beautiful music from start to finish at the concert i attended i was lucky enough to be able to chat with fareed he s a great guy and he told me all the instrumental jazz solos he did live and on the macedonian blues album were improvised his technique is one that any guitarist can learn from and i have i highly recommend this album to absolutely anyone finally after my mm camera was lost in a move i decided to take the plunge into digital my wife was sold on the x zoom and many reveiwers selected this as the top camera in that category since the purchase it has consistently performed above all my expectations i can print x pictures with great detail or take multiple lower quality pictures to e mail to family we just had twins and use this camera every day to update the family all of our friends and family have been impressed with the quality ease of use and versatility of the camera and we have convinced four others to make the same purchase one reccomendation spend the money on the megabyte card i have never had to worry about a full memory card since we bought the big one pros great picture quality ease of use amazing zoom con not the smallest camera on the marketreccomended accessories rechargable aa batteries megabyte smartmedia card being a furry myself i was drawn to this book simply by looking at the cover art in fact the art throughout even at the beginning is really sweet compared to what else was out there at the time the character development and facial expressions are there and done quite nicely although mark rest his soul doesn t explain where maya the elephant comes in she s just there starting in one chapter and then for the duration speaking of development you see friendship begin between marphissa and alix not to mention how the girls start to develope the muscles and strength necessary to be warriors i thoroughly enjoyed this book cover to cover and can promise you won t regret making this purchase i purchased this book as a gift for gotcha day a tradition started in our family when we picked up our new granddaughter at the airport she has been exposed to a lot of korean culture as a reminder of her birth country she is an avid reader at the age of six and loves this book as well as her mother and grandmother i recommend it to any parent or grandparent of a korean child the data on intimate partner violence has shown for over years that women initiate of the fights men initiate of the fights and the remaining of mutually violent couples this book gives voice to those men who are victimized and who deserve to be heard in now way does recognizing this take away from the voice of women victims of abuse rather this helps us acknowledge that abuse is a family issue not a gender one love the story love the choice of casts would definitely watch this movie multiple times i did not think of wanting to collect the batman series but after watching the whole movies i would like to have them as our family s private movie collection i was reading all the reviews to figure out if this was a toy for my yr son it was the only thing he asked for for christmas so i went to toys r us thinking i wasn t not going to buy this toy cause there is no zurg with or avaliable on amazon we found a zurg in the store yes you need to buy is seperately no surprise that is life so for every one who said they couldn t find it no offence leave your pc and go look for it go to the store the story takes place in at the beginning of the baseball strike and baseball reporter kate henry has no games to cover she is at home in toronto contemplating the strike she and two teenage friends share some concern for an apparently homeless woman maggie who lives in an alley near their apartment their is some racial unrest in toronto since the shooting of a black man by the police this is a well written well plotted and fascinating study of the homeless the difficulties of policework and the affects of trauma on relationships a very enjoyable read with an active intelligent and capable heroine the other characters are believable and fun this is a good starting point for anyone wishing to investigate lou reed s career it includes his early hit walk on the wild side plus mesmerising versions of sweet jane and white light white heat and the tracks come from albums as diverse as berlin transformer sally can t dance and coney island baby it s a greart selection of songs my favourites being satellite of love why wasn t this one a huge hit single the campy new york telephone conversation and the aforementioned melodic acidic and original this is the very best of early lou reed the transformation of beck from street musician to eclectic recording artist and songwriting wizard must have been a difficult one and we see an awful lot of pain in the album the songs all have a serious sad sometimes powerful tone to them which is not actually matched by the lyrics when you take a good listen there is hope there but what really impressed me was the arrangements there are a lot of strings on here and the arrangements vary from sparse to bombastic the fourth song lonesome tears in particular has one of the most powerful string arrangements ever commited to disc those arrangements it s obvious that great care was taken in making this album something which cannot be said for all releases i played it awfully loud yesterday and became thoroughly involved it is a participatory album not one that listens well in the background you pretty much have to pay attention to this one i had recieved this in days i started this the next day i feel a big different in how i feel i have more patients i feel more in peace i heard about this product from dr oz it does not give me energy it make you feel you can face any problems without cause there seem to be a lot of reviews questioning the validity of buerger s sources so i feel it needs to be said that buerger is fairly objective in writing the mysteries of godliness i am a faithful mormon and very much enjoyed reading the rich sources provided by buerger it is true that a lot of the sources are anti mormons but in a lot of cases this is because only disaffected mormons would talk about certain things at that time anyhow equal time is given to church prophets as to disaffected members and dissenters buerger s only occasionally insensitive in regards to the spiritual worth of temple ceremonies to the members of the church but this is a history book and so spiritual manifestations and comfort aren t things that buerger can gauge without becoming more biased overall i think this is a great book for those seeking to learn more about the history surrounding latter day saint temple ceremonies you simply cannot get a better toy for the price especially in the year old group what you have here is basically a decent plastic chess set with a cardboard playing board the pieces are large inches good for smaller hands and have a nice weight to them i m giving this set a high score for durability because the pieces seem pretty indestructible and will probably get lost long before they break or wear out but the cardboard playing board may need to be replaced or repaired read duct taped after heavy use or rough handling kids will love that the pieces look just like the life sized set ron played in the first movie and hey in my opinion there just isn t a more educational toy than a chess set harry potter books helped many kids discover they like to read now harry potter can help kids develop an interest in chess cool this novel is extremely well written and organized that it so allows the reader to absorb the tremendous amount of dazzling information being explored yet not feeling overwhelmed this book is truly thorough when it comes to teaching me how to interpret poetry i would most definitely recommend it to my friends i think this cd is great i purchased the cd as soon as it hit the stands i ve been listening to it every since i love every song on it i just knew everyone would fall in love with my love is your love it is a great song inexpensive and good quality piano bench fully adjustable in height and easy to put together takes maybe minutes the seat is very comfortable and squishy without being so soft there s no support definitely would recommend for regular piano players an excellent review and explanation of our u s of a constitution every american could benefit from reading it this dvd is all it said it would be johnathan ryes myers is stellar as elvis as he is in the tudors he has become one of my favorite actors and seems to be able to portray many historical characters the whole cast was wonderful and i loved it and will play it many times over in the future i bought this program a while ago for a function it couldn t do but it is in my opinion the best mp creator an interesting book that educates and helps people view money saving investing passive cashflow etc more accurately kiyosaki seminars are over priced especially if they only repeat what is already said in the books however the books themselves contain more than enough information on their own anyway unless you are a person like the many who ve reviewed this book just to tell everyone you already know everything kiyosaki explains this book is worth reading he is educational unless you already knew it all of course i personally find the writing style a bit alarmist in nature something no other reviewer has commented on interestingly but if kiyosaki genuinely thinks that s what the future holds he should say so for me the best points were let em scream ie pay yourself first and kiyosaki s paradigm busting views on your house being an asset i received this cd from a friend and was thrilled to find it available here at amazon com as well because i truly dig this cd this guy is an amazing writer and artist the songs are unlike others heard before i am amazed that we are not hearing him on national radio stations yet hopefully soon truly an amazing cd with no let down hoping for another to be released in the future love it love it love it this mouse works great with my new dell laptop the thumb pad or whatever you call it is horrible it gets stuck all the time life is much easier with this mouse i have small hands and it fits me perfectly this works only with the lacrosse indoor weather stations but it works very well most of the time this winter has been unusually cold and after a couple of days in the single digits or teens the signal disappears until it warms up again it is nice to have the outdoor temperature and relative humidity at least most of the time this is my fourth lisa jackson novel i enjoy all her books lots of action romance suspense but the only negative point i would give it is the ending what happened to dani any comments from readers would be appreciated i don t usually read sci fi or thrillers and i especially don t read political stuff but for some reason i found myself picking up this curious little novel maybe it was the ominous cover with america screaming at you in huge metallic letters and the techno fugitive illustration like some future nightmare bladerunner world anyway while the novel can sometimes get a little bit preachy it clearly has an anti bush agenda i found it surprisingly entertaining it s an easy read and it quite vividly lays out for you what might happen if our current leaders continue on in the direction they re heading sometimes you think this couldn t possibly happen in our country but then you read about the new security detector machines already in use at the statue of liberty and airports that sniff your boarding pass and and scan your bodies and you think hmmm maybe this isn t so farfetched after all scary thought i can t add too much more than what s already been said other than to concur with all who say these crackers are delicious and versatile plus if you re doing weight watchers you can eat for points so delicious nutritious and calorically compact it s hard to describe what s so good about them other than to say that they are a delicious combo of salty sweet and sesame flavors great just as they are out of the box and due to the whole grains and fiber content crackers is a satisfying snack as others have said they are hard to find on the grocery store when i do find them i buy them up so buying in bulk on amazon is a good alternative do you like late s madonna or pet shop boys if you enjoy dance pop at its finest you must pick up this cd this man is hot hot hot and the music is even hotter i picked up a copy of his now out of print debut cd but this one is club music at its finest listen to the club friendly grooves of jump the rump or the bass laden tracks days and nights or show me how the remake of little red corvette sizzles i dare you to sit through it without tapping some part of your body it puts prince s original to shame yes to shame no true club or dance music fan should be without the cd of the year this is a good movie shows that something can be done about what goes on in this world that shouldn t i originally purchased books and came here to check if there were other books in this series and was happy to find books and i am anal about reading book series in order the story started out slow for me but as i kept reading i became more interested which was a good thing as i already had books and that wouldn t be good as i am also anal about reading what i buy i like that the story takes a very contemporary approach re magic and the fey or fatae as they are referred to in the book it s comical how wren has such a difficult time with computers and cell phones as we take so much of these things for granted it s annoying though how many calories she can pack in and be thin as a result of her current usage talk about a fantasy the one thing i felt was distracting was the type set of the paper back but i was gratified that the rest of the books very not in that type set all in all a good beginning to the series i enjoy sci fi thriller s this is the second book in the two book set mortal eclipseis the first many parts are difficult to follow as minimum explanation is given toexplain the action story line a lot going on and the author knows the direction intent but it is not always clear the other demensional beings just arrive the heronever seems to know the source of the great evil it s just some evil that aside i stillgive this set good marks a good read i am using the first blade it works well i think however i expect it is little cheaper i don t think there are words that can descripe the music on this record this hendrix recording is my personal favorite listen to it and you will understand the cd s name just a few questions by clay walker is my favorite song on the cd all of his songs are great of course stories that touch the heart for sports lovers my husband travels and misses some of the televised episodes got him volume last year and now volume he loves them this is one of the best book i have ever red well written and and absolutely in details if you have red how to grow rich you need to read this book to follow up this book needs to be read as much as the great controversy it is much easier to read while still giving us a vivid picture of the end times categorized by subject for easy referencing the story was quite entertaining christopher s vampires were done more as unique creatures with human qualities we saw them as the good guys through the eyes of humans and also each other chris may visited me early in the book process finally got my copy a very enjoyable box of candy with some hard pieces i learned a lot and left the book understanding more than i ever expected a recommended read for the professional and lay alike morley barn org well i had to wait two weeks for the machine to finally ship in spite of the ships in hours assertation from amazon but it finally arrived the box was broken on the corner so i was afraid that i too would suffer the shipping disaster that has plagued too many who have purchased this machine i guess i m lucky because the mortiser had no damage set up took less than minutes and it cuts nice clean straight mortises a little tweaking to get it fine tuned and it s ready to go easy to use good manual and heavy duty by modern standards construction overall it s a great buy for the price best machine for the money i ve seen especially after looking at the shop fox and others with wooden bases if you have the patience to wait out the long shipping times the guts to take a chance on it not being destroyed and the need for a good mortiser at a great price buy this thing it will make a great addition to your shop great book i recently reread this about years after i first did as a year old and again enjoyed it immensely it is a real rip roaring page turner that i found hard to put down as there is very little let up in the action it isn t a cheesy fairytale either with several truly awful people portrayed in it quite a few of whom die some nasty deaths it is a riveting read for any body with an active imagination full of salty sea dogs piratical sayings nautical manoeuvering sword play and double crosses it s time it was remade as a movie i recommend this book wholeheartedly to young and old readers as with a woman of substance this movie carries on with emma harte s granddaughter paula who is charged to hold emma s dream true to her previous movie this story stuck very close to the book i love this story and i can t wait to watch the third one to be the best watch and love though this latest concert capture sounds more like a bootleg album and less like a professional live recording it still holds some of the great mysterious forbidden and energetic live elements that have made the mission famous over the years once you get past that answering machine like sound quality the songs really grab you and the spirit and vibe of the live mission show shines through the song performances are great there are some interesting and insightful passages by wayne hussey in the cd booklet and the cover artwork is classic mission this is a must have for real missionaries just finished watching this film and i would highly recommend it to anyone the story unfolds as the samurai agree to defend a village from bandits the movie builds up the final battle scene and the forces of good are victorious over evil great movie and the action is great i just got this today so i haven t had it long enough to give a review but i noticed that other reviews commented on how you can only see the title of the song in the display and not the artist what is shown in the display is what is in the title category when it s on your computer if you go to the file and right click and go to properties then clikc on the summary tab there will be a box for title just type in whatever you want for the title and that is what will be displayed on the mp player a quick way to see what the titles are is if you look at the files using detailed list to view them where it shows all the info about the files if you right click at the top where it says name size filetype etc it will give you the option of displaying the title this way you can easily look down your list and figure out which ones you need to change hopefully this will help some people i ll write a review of the mp later when i have used it more not sure why but we have had problems with other free and clears with the kids skin but the tide does not break out their skin this auto replenish is going to get out of hand for me when will amazon start selling groceries the planet bike protege bike computer is an excellent choice for a simple easy to use and reasonably accurate bike computer it is very easy to install by following the instructions read the instructions thoroughly and understand how it works before you install it use the measured method rather than the tire size to set up the speedometer it is more accurate my computer is accurate to feet for a measured mile with some tweaking i will be able to fix thisas for the other complaints i have read about this computer i disagree the temperature is reasonably accurate in the shade i have never seen a thermometer that didn t read high in direct sunlight you have to hold the button for seconds before the data is zeroed out i have had no problem losing data during a ride as i shift from screen to screen again if you understand how this computer works it will do the job for you i highly recommend this bike computer california writer lynn freed spins the tale of agnes la grange a plucky young englishwoman who has immigrated to so africa after wwi the greatest pleasure of this book is engrossing yourself in agnes s desires she wants to experience adventure and passion without feeling she s being dominated by a man remember this was the edwardian era when women were given more to fits of the vapors that to fits of passion it s a pleasure to read along as agnes struggles not to succumb to the mores of her time as author freed grew up in south africa her book is all the more compelling for its presumed accuracy at least it feels accurate a sense lent credence by the photographs which are included if you have never read a book in french but are willing to try pick up this one it may not be her finest work but it s extremely funny and easy to read you ll find yourself lol ing and loving it i ve looked at the sample pages of the english translation and they seem pretty good but if you feel like improving your french this copy is what you are looking for it took me long hot baths to finish it pure pleasure for the brain wrinkles for my skin in any case she s refreshing it may be way up there on the cheesy and unrealistic scale but naughty marietta is an awesome movie to watch when you re feeling low the music is fabulous jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy have the best voices i have ever heard and the movie leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling it s also a movie for all ages my grandmother loves it and i a teenager do too they would sing at the coffee house shop the lemon tree on wayne ave in dayton ohio this album has traveled in and out of my life several times i am estatic to discover it once again yes it is that good the songs are plesant paths to stroll down for any folk music fan or thought you might like to give it a listen you will be hooked on the words music and most original lyrics as these two voices play blend with one another in the most delightful way we had to read this for english honors and when i first saw how long it was i was not looking forward to it although it does have a pretty thick plot and the long names tend to be confusing the book is generally stunning something you will not regret reading and that will remain with you for always the funny thing is that i read this novel on my commute to work every morning what i loved about this book is it s real i really long for lesbian orientated novel that are contrived or too on the edge in the character s lifestyle that i can t connect i could connect with this book i even think that i think a bit like the narrator including driving to far for love there is some personal stuff i think about trisha todd which is kinda nice if you ever wondered what she was up to i guess that really helped the book become more real get it if you want a read that you don t have to say aw come on about this is a collection of cowboy music not real cowboy music but rather the commercialized version that first became popular in the s with the advent of singing cowboy movies the four cds in this set are divided by themes disc one is cowboy classics these are some of the best known western songs disc two is silver screen cowboys these are songs sung by western stars disc three is gene autry roy rogers these are songs by the two most popular singing cowboys gene and roy also appear on all the other discs disc four is movie television themes these are the theme songs from westerns some of which are instrumentals this is a really fun collection especially for fans of old time westerns lil kim has a great rapping voice and at the same time can do a slow ballid i really enjoyed her album and i wouldn t trade it for any other kim knows how to throw it down all the best to you queen bee my yr old just loves this book he takes it on trips pours over the pages in search for the hidden items gets cousins and mom and dad involved as kind of a family past time activity he somehow lost his first copy of the book several yrs ago and we thought we d find it when we cleaned up house whoever has it must love it as much as my son or they would ve returned it we looked for it at the websites for stores we d seen it at in the past since we never found it he was very excited when we saw it on amazon he looked in the mail for it everyday thanks for having it available hey guys i agree with chris in that these are all the tops when it comes to comedy in my opinion though glorious is the best of eddie s stuff even when compared to dress to kill eddie izzard is to be experienced by everyone this guy is hilarious don t hold back buy one of these packs for yourself and tell your friends i have had the privilege to study with gene after playing guitar myself for plus years gene bertoncini is all heart soul a true master of the fret board who knows every chord interpretation for every chord change he can make the music transcend the listeners conscious and take you places you haven t imagined yet anyone who appreciates fine music will resonate with mr bertoncini s candor sensitivity and sense of humor these seem to be a good quality item i had trouble finding a pan with bigger cups in the store i had room to make a double roll and they didn t stick i ve been really happy with this season so far it s not just a zombie show but there s plenty of zombie action to remind you that they are there there s lot of emotion and thought provoking narrative to make the show interesting on several levels i d recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a good drama with fine acting and good writing a desire to watch a realistic show that also has zombies is not necessary but will definitely be rewarded this game stands up well to the test of time i ve had if for years and still occasionally pop it in it is credited as being the first game to use the a button grapple b button strike game engine which has won several fighting game awards although it isn t the first one to use it the game does have its flaws still beats revenge in replay value some characters cough bischoff cough are weak and worthless while others are um like who the heck is black widow lol all in all a great game which is the infant form of wrestlemania and the soon to be released hopefully wwf no mercy this is a great tool if you use earthware pots and pans works well for cooking ground beef and separating or mashing certain foods when a metal utensil can t be used well i work in a bookshop have been reading since i was a young little thing but i must say that of all the books i have read in such a long time none have come close to touching me so deeply as this book it deals with all the issues young love family pressures friendships and that all in the first few pages jodi picoult really knows how to write exactly the right thing at exactly the right time none of her books have been a disappointment believe me out of all the booksi recommend to friends families customers this would have to be one of the few which i always get great feedback about so if you re thinking about getting this great book hesitate no longer do yourself a favour put your feet up make free a whole afternoon get immersed only every time i see you this movie is a serious trip like mulholland drive in that you ll watch it several times and experience those aha moments now i get it i give it stars instead of due to some plot holes but this is one of those movies that you ll want in your dvd collection the bonus disc has all the features you d expect plus the option of watching the movie in sequence the original movie runs backwards kind of that s really not an apt description it s just kind of trippy i loved joey pants in this thing he did a great job i am probably not the greatest authority on the genre of horror movies but this one while it is certainly one of the best falls short of the excellent reviews and attention it is given the theme is interesting possession is something that has fascinated people throughout the history of human beings and the movie is filmed pretty well nothing much to complain about for some reason i just can t bring myself to give it stars though maybe if i was religous i would find the film more intriguing as it is i do not find it very frightening but well done if you want to listen to a band that is true to themselves and not a sell out then buy this album these men are unbeliveable just plain great with all the stuff out there this is a breath of fresh air so glad to see these guys still rocking their concert is a must see wore it with the other bracelet yesterday very good color when the light shines on it love it a lot very happy with my purchase but i liked it i laughed and giggled almost all the way through this third ya ya book i enjoyed the chapter story line even though the chapters jump around and skip decades at a time i recognized the judgemental myrtis for what she was and understood her chapter was a way of explaining that her nutty daughter didn t fall far from the family tree ms wells or her editors needed better proofing of the family trees on the inside covers of the book i understand how many other readers might not like the book in fact i am thankful i didn t read the reviews until after i read ya yas in bloom i enjoyed reading it i couldn t put it down little alters left a bad taste in my mouth and in bloom turned the bitter to sweet this event has an abosolutly amazing table ladders and chairs match and a fantastic main event but the result was disapionting with the rock emerging victorious kane was unmasked and shane falls about ft from the entrance set recomended ok this review might be long but this gun is a great buy its worth the money i got mine in like days i had some problem at first changing out the barrels with the push down barrel hold that is a spring the grenade auncher iisnt even a grenade launcher just stick some bbs down the barrel pump and shoot more like a shotgun if u ask me the gun hits about fps the and round magazine it came with worked well but burned rounds quick buy some extra magazines off airsplat or something like that the peq box doesnt work just for show or u can put the battery in it it comes with tactical rails for scopes or holographic sights also coms with a fore grip for some support when firing made mainly metal the stock is plastic that is the only plastic part really charge the battery for minutes use only gram bbs with this gun lower quality bbs will jam and eventually break the feeding mechanisim inside the gun worth the buy this bouncy seat has worked well for us i like to snug enclosed feel that the canopy provides as well as the locations where toys can be attached the music modes are pleasant and not too loud i like the fact that the music turns off automatically after awhile otherwise i would forget and run through allot of batteries the vibration mode however keeps running until you turn it off and is a great soother when the baby is fussy one note of caution is that the wire frame legs extend out a bit from the seat itself this makes the seat very stable but also makes it easy to hit your toes on it or maybe it s just me all in all we love this bouncy seat i first saw these guys in new york two years ago where they blew me away with their job play i just caught their show hip hop dummeez in toronto and bought the cd i have to say not only is this lyrically one of the most inspiring albums i ve ever heard i don t know how they come up with this stuff but the music is extraordinary i wasn t necessarily expecting that for someone who never bought a hip hop album in his life this was a great way to start this is one of the best horror movies ever made the script is well done and also the movie i think all the crew of this picture are excellent i give a and oscar for all the original script and everything see this movie you ll enjoy it and you ll never forget it the book i recieved was as how it was described in good condition it arrived sooner than i thought overall i am completly satisfied with my purchase stark s book is criticized here several times for not addressing mid and upper body muscle groups if i want advice on what to do about atherosclerosis i will go see a cardiac specialist and if i want expert advice for feet and closely associated physiology i will read stark because his methods and communication skills are among the best unlike some experts stark does not arrogantly venture beyond the scope of his discipline stark is a podiatrist maybe some of the complainants should have checked out his credentials before purchase this collection is very nice to have wether you are getting it on with your ruca or cruising your lowrider down the boulevard their sound was not as aggresive as malo or azteca they had a sound all their own the latin influence was always there along with the eastside sound every song tells a story here in the barrio that is why all chicanos latinos can relate to tierra these are some of their best songs this is a great cd to have in your collection for all you chicano and old school fans i recomend back to the barrio rare and hard to find chicano classics compilation you should contact www chorizomusic yahoo com this makes playing the game so much easier you can view you cards at all times without straining your hands especially good if you have arthritis the very first film in the saga we get to see obi wan s master qui gon jinn teach his young padawan and little anakin skywalker and the ultimate villain of the film is darth maul weilding a double bladed lightsaber a gret film if you are a fan of the star wars films see it today rated pg for sci fi action and violence this dvd has the both final four games against duke and georgia tech with commercials and timeouts taken out so its nice to relive the uconn memories the other part of the dvd is a recap of the ncaa tournament run highlighted with the final four teams this dvd is a bit more lively than uconn s top dogs dvd but doesn t cover the regular season i have both and is a must for uconn fans go uconn i read the book during a flight from naples to milan and couldn t wait to reach the very unexpected end mr laurie wrote one of the most exciting and funny novel i ever read and even if the book has some jimmy bond scent you can easily see that the writer has his unique and very thoughtful style you will love this book and feel that it s been a good thing to meet mr t lang after all elegante reloj casio con maquina y correa de metal facil de ajustar a la mu eca sacando eslabones de la correa broche abre facil muy seguro jaglvzla i remember his running for new york city major i read this book in college he know he was not going to be elected but buckley put the conservative party on the map in that campaign and in his brother james buckly was elected to the office of us senator from new york state on the conservative party line james buckley was a very significant senator i have been following mr winter s writings for a while now and he is an enjoyable author with an interesting perspective on life love and faith well worth the time take it from a family of with trips to vegas under our belts we all love that city and we love the ug we ve bought every annual iteration for the past years your savings in both effort and money will cover the price of the book your first hour in town treat the book with care however as the bindings in mine have all broken relatively quickly when i purchased this set i was looking at the titles my tutor tomboy and my chauffer which were sorta popular in the early s these titles alone made the price reasonable on this package the film jocks was great for a first screeening however there are two films on this package that just plain suck pom pom girls and the van may have their place in s icon fodder but they suck on this set of films wished this set contained a few more usa up all night standards such as h o t s hollywood hot tubs however it does not a great find if you are a fan of classic teenage b movies the movies on this set are my tutor my chauffeur hunk tomboy jocks weekend pass the pom pom girls the van this book is for anyone serious about learning the guitar well it was my standard method in college and up to this point i have not found a better overall method for learning the guitar the exercises and etudes contained in the method will work many aspects of one s playing at the same time we purchased this zire for our year old son for his birthday i have had previous palm products before and have had fair success with them but for the price this one could not be beat we had trouble loading the cd with all the software but i have experienced this before with palm products if you have another palm already loaded and no longer use that one it is very difficult to delete and the second one will not load properly it s almost like a virus i solved this by getting the basic download from the website and the palm is almost fully functional overall he loves the features and it has exactly what he needs nothing fancy purely functional\n"

      " i purchased this item for my father and it is unusable because it does not fit his standard walker as the item description and label states the openings on the sides are not long enough to accommodate standard walkers people need to use walkers due to lack of stability this product is not compliant with the needs of users because it requires delicate balancing to remain in place the story is very inaccurate and was written by a very biased viewpoint i have read further into the life of olive oatman and while there are many conflicting stories this one is inaccurate even as far as the tribe who actually captured them we have to remember that this account was written at a time when all indians were seen as blood thirsty savages and the truth was often hollywoodized a well meaning but totally sloppy book botn in writing style and clarity of thought interesting for the range of topics it suggests relate to its subject although its coverage of them is aweful it is somewhat useful for the references it offers in case the frustrated reader is still interested enough in the topics to try and make up for the book s own failures by reading up on them elsewhere as for the rest it is hard to follow and confusing on all but the most elementary points this is an almost made it they are table legs they fold but they don t do it well or not as well as the price should justify i have no complaint with the oven when it works but there are technical problems in months of use the knobs have broken off twice that means shipping the item to the repair center for me a cost of and waiting for it to be fixed as of this writing i ve been waiting for one month and two days for the oven to be fixed and the repair center told me it does not yet have the necessary parts to fix it other problems the door does not close properly the door handle is loose and the heating coils bend so that i cannot remove the bottom tray without bending them back into position i think this unit is defective but so far delonghi has refused to replace it i am contacting my state consumer complaint division to pursue this further i ve never purchased a more expensive toaster oven and have never had as many problems as with this one i never cared for don imus his views and radio talk were all based on insulting other people no matter who they were so this book is as hollow as the man who wrote it today with don imus having been fired from radio after saying one bad thing too many i can at last say that the whole country have at last seen the man for what he was and said enough be gone now i like old movies but i couldn t follow this one that much very old but i just couldn t watch it all the way thru i got it because joseph schildkraut was in it he was in marie antionette and he was outstanding in that picture but i just couldn t get into this one plot is not great thank you i purchased an audiovox dvd prior to a series of trips across the country it remained in its case whenever not in use and i was very careful with handling and precautions just as with the previous reviewers all of a sudden the unit started freezing up then refused to play any dvds further the spinning of the dvds in the unit started to make a squeaking noise and i was concerned that continued attempts at getting it to work would probably only result in damage to the dvds themselves so back to target it went where it was cheerfully accepted back and my credit card credited the material for this study was good but the questions asked in the guide were redundant they did not inspire thinking read the bible reference answer the question no thought required done other women of faith studies that were done better bought this for my casio exilim ex z perfect fit for everyday use at home downside will not protect camera from dust and other fine particle i brought the sample size at wal mart for or so thank god i didn t invest in a full size it says its for daily use but i find that hard to believe this stuff dries my skin out like no other product ive used it has exfoliating beads in it that are way too harsh for my face it you insist in getting this set aside some money for a moisturizer you ll need it from a dell employee consider yourself warned if you think you can read michael s book and think you ll know what it s like at dell i m paraphrasing but among other things michael says dell is a non political environment hah he also says that performance reviews and bonuses are based on degree review hah they are in reality based on the kind of subjective curve based direct manager reviews that michael so righteously rails against in the book look it up either michael is out of touch or someone else wrote that book come on people everybody knows that this is true the limp bizkit song is not for the true fans of the group there is no heavy metal parts and also there is no cussing the theme songs are way too short i got it for kid rock and limp bizkit the song blast is kid rock s all time worst song ever the only reason that i gave it stars is that the metallica song seek and destroy is on it if you want true wrestling themes then go for wwf the music if you want the real version of faith then get the cd three bill y all the explicit lyrics version so i took a dump forgot to flush went to watch this movie mid movie went back upstairs to flush and ended up watching the turd instead as that was more interesting my baby loves peeling it off and walking around the house with it the protection is good but is not helpful because it just wont stay i was there tucker is correct parenti has no call whatsoeverto write the bulljive smack he does in this book about miketucker ian olds garrett scott and christian parenti allhid behind a gun truck in the middle of the day on thatmission jan fallujah i saw it i was there thisparatrooper knows and damn right mike tucker has all theright in the world to set the record straight and heis the only one who has returned to iraq in deep to honorour warriors fitting that he does not cast any stones inhis books on war at journalists because tucker understandsthat journalists are not the story the warriors are a paratrooper alpha company st th nd airborne we thought that this book was on the boring side because there should of been more action or excitement our favorite part was when her grandmother came over our suggestions are to add more excitement and to make the book a little longer handel s music is of course grand and beautiful i applaud susan hammond s creativity and her hopes to introduce children to classical music however the fictional storyline is just that fictional your and your child s impression and memories of handel will forever falsely be tied to this fictional storyline of thomas katerina and handel which never occured there are of course elements of truth in the storyline but the majority never happened buy some cd s of handel s wonderful music and listen with your family there are several good books you can read about handel s real life and they are not boring my dog tore this thing up in about a half hour unfortunately we also have the tire by the same company and that thing is still great i would only recommend the jack maybe for puppies you can hide treats in it but certainly not any dog that has a history of making short work of cheap toys this cd will sell records only because of mtv promoting theatrics lets all be honest and say what we truly feel this album was rushed and the quality of the music as a whole shows it out of countless tracks there are probably only worthwhile songs they are mediocre at best rappers with poor studio production what else can we expect from a loser like poop diddy who will do anything for money do not buy this trash this movie is an abysmal waste of time i should have spent the time more productively by working a crossword puzzle or something this book marks the sad disintegration of what might have been a great series by robert jordan into a verbose confusing fragmented unsatisfying mess those who dared to compare him to tolkien in his earlier works will lament with me the death of what might have been save yourself some money go to the bookstore and read the last chapter that will keep you informed enough to make sense of what comes in the next book maybe and it will keep you from having to slush through page after page of boredom were it not for a desire to find out what finally happens to rand and the world i would probably give up on this series as a novelist myself the legacy savage press oct i began reading james burke s latest tome with an eye towards learning something about the great american west and the interplay between the land and burke s fictional charactors while the desciptions of montana soared and provided a stunning background to bitterroot the lack of any meaningful plot and the use of cardboard people to populate the landscape was disappointing i had never read any of burke s stuff i was anticipating a northern version of tony hillerman i was sorely disappointed the bedbook format is so unusual it should be made more clear to purchasers i wouldn t have been interested if i had known this this movie wasted my time and money this movie really stinks the actors cant act the story line is stupid and there is nood gang fights it deserved two stars because of the violence but thats all that was good a look into the lives of the very wealthy however very few chapters are footnoted or sourced the few that are use works that can hardly be considered worthy of more than the trash heap listening to music like this it s easy to believe that there was no good music before the rock era i have tried three of the sweet style breads trying to make something my kids would like the have all looked good they rise nicely and have good texture but they are quite boring tasting and no one actually liked them especially my picky kids to be fair i haven t yet tried the basic wheat bread oat bread loaves but those recipes are everywhere and i was looking for something different i sure hate it when bread is no good what a waste of time and ingredients i was able somehow to install systemworks but the errors and issues would not stop and had to rollback to my previous version i used this version and it offers nothing new to the version other than the same ussual ui change bundled with millions of new bugs only wish i had found a better alternative than symantec i would switch without hesitation please spare yourself from this installation nightmare and renew your currently working version i spent a whole weekend just repairing the failed installation of and rolling back to the title of the review succinctly states my feelings the most annoying thing about this book and their last several is that they are slowly grinding their earlier works of genius into insignificance as brilliant as the belgariad was it simply cannot outweigh the tripe that these two have been subjecting us to i ve always been slightly amused by eddings note about the belgariad that it was a project to test out and refine certain ideas about the fantasy genre well i d recommend scrapping the real work and get back to some serious testing please postscript rest in peace david while i regret that our author reader relationship ended on this sadder note i cannot thank you enough for the wonder you infused into my life with your work if you had not been so truly great earlier i would not have felt such harsh disappointment later based on the majority of positive reviews of the er c i expected to have crystal clear sound quality with some comfort trade off because of the ear piece design in reality i was almost right about the ear piece almost being the degree of discomfort with that thing jammed in my ear made for short and infrequent calls as for the crystal clear sound quality that never happened not once maybe my expectations were too high but i sent mine back and picked the ear bud that came with my iphone which is comfortable and works fine i will admit i was not impressed with this film it just did not work for me the entire time i was thinking when will it end i m sure others will enjoy it but it was too slow of a storyline to keep me wanting to watch it or care about the key players the same formula repeated over and over and over with forced coincidences that go nowhere disappointed i can t imagine how anybody could have developed a so called pet food and water bowl that stinks this bad it s the blue rubber thing on the bottom it s probably the most ignorant product design i ve seen i tried finding durapet online to give some feedback directly to the manufacturer but just found people selling the stuff this book was entirely too predicatble you could read the first pages and the last pages and not have missed anything but confusing sex and a dragged on plot line subtle hints the kidnappers left were supposed to leave you on the edge of your seat but all they did was make you sick of them because they were repeated over and over to the point where you just skip over it this book was a big let down froma good author i love them but the hope there s someone has much more intensity and truth in the ballads less instruments less interference still love them though man this is an overrated album if the reviews here are to be believed there best come on i was really looking forward when i bought this cd to be extraordinary with bruce adrian smith back iron maiden was back yea finally three axe men man this was going to be a guitar fest most of the songs are mid tempo boring and long without power guitar parts are bland at best with three axe men how can this be bruce s solo albums accident of birth and chemical wedding are better than this album i never play this album although it does have about three good songs on it i was disappointed big time with another great metal band putting out a bland album so i give only one star this is the worst cd i have ever heard it lacks any contentdont buy it any cd on the shelf would surpass this one the poster should have been a warning hes holding a flashlight she has the axe yet shes the one hiding a better punishment than grounding your kids for a month or if you want to make a bad mood worse go out of your way and see this i doubt a storyline needs to be explained or gone into detail but for those with single digit iqs dumb broad is locked in an underground paking lot and chased by a lonely guy they took red eye from the sky and removed the action drama what little there was yawn this book is perhaps the only text book in the market which deals with this particular subject this is perhaps the only reason why the book is still being sold the book is very difficult to understand the language is often cryptic and the most critical mathematical steps are ommitted during derivations which makes this book practically useless however if you are already familiar with the principles of advanced solid mechanics you may find this book relatively useful until someone writes a better book i guess we are stuck with this out of stars buyers beware if the battery you re watching before you make the purchase does nt have the interstate label on it you re going to receive a cheap knock off no matter what the description says shame on them this appears to be a cheap chinese knockoff update battery is failing to hold charge tested charger and it is ok junk it was hard to get it assembled even then i couldn t adjust the height so i adjusted me to fit the stand it actually worked pretty good for about two weeks then i turned my head and the dryer fell off and broke the stand all gone now just another piece of broken plastic taking up space i originally wrote a review endorsing this product but the stuff i ordered from amazon was not good it used to be the only lubricant that worked but this batch and i bought boxes doesn t work at all don t waste your money i purchased this in feb based on the high reviews so far i found the picture quality to be about as bad as any camera i have owned the flash either overexposes or underexposes the worst part of all is the lack of crispness and vibrant colors to the pictures flash or no flash i will try a premium quality paper to remedy this though i should nt have to in order to get decent photos i disagree with those who say that dolly is just trying to cash in with this album as i do think it comes across as very heartfelt and sincere at the same time i think the results are less than enjoyable mainly due to a lack of originality in the song selection and worse the forced humor emphasized by the can laughter sincere this album is subtle it is not first day was great the day after it was on the bottom off the pool full of water there is a little hole on the side and one on the top great reception they hurt can use it as an antenna then plug in some other earphones at the same time this one dosen t stop them from working as well these monsters jam in your ears and are really uncomfortable give us something with better headphone to ear contact ouch thank goodness i borrowed this book from the library and did not buy it i share other reviewers dissapointments as i enjoyed carr s other books but don t even bother with this one i had the motorola adaptor and then got this linksys vonage adaptor this model linksys unit has a terrible background noise that is always present which sounds like a fax coming on on another telephone line that is bleeding through to the voice line i ve tried two both with the same result using multiple telephones i don t have the problem at all with the motorola device i ve not tried the newer linksys device which doesn t include a router where the sociopath kills everyone maybe we should build the wall between texas the us rather than mexico the us and if we can make the wall retroactive to the s we would all be better off amazing what gets on the top ten listyou staying young the owner s manual for extending your warranty when will newark learn that gorgeous mcbride illustrations do not mean he can write utter rubbish so many errors it s actualy funny at times at other times it s just sad to see nice art get wasted on a terrible book this movie should be avoided at all costs i started watching it and i turned to stone it was as enjoyable as watching medusa please stay away tom and nicole are still in therapy over this thing all you artsy types are quick to jump on the bandwagon of anything that is strange and unusual well this movie is not strange and unusual it is strange and this book reads like a romance novel and doesn t have much depth the characters aren t very well defined and they seem two dimensional i ve read other much better historical novels than this nothing to recommend this ridculous nonsense it was one of the most boring movies i have ever watched and has zero to recommend it don t waste your time i love movies but this goes in the trash i watched this because it comes up as a recommended film like a cult classic clearly those critics were high when they saw this movie this movie is absolutely terrible there are such huge plot holes that you practically have to go into a concussion to understand what s going on i m so surprised that brad pitt s career didn t go down the pooper cause this movie had bad acting and animation all around it s incredibly cheesy and at times annoying at least with who framed roger rabbit the humans felt like they were interacting with the toons and were physically affected by their presence this film was like watching amateur mimes could they have at least looked in the direction of the toons they were interacting with it s like they decided to just look left of the camera at all times instead of at the fictional character if they remake this movie it can only be for the better it appears to work just fine for getting rid of mice but the red light flashes and emits a small beeping clicking sound the one in the garage doesn t bother us but the one that meant to be used in the house was too annoying this warmer heats differently every time sometimes the formula is way too hot and sometimes it feels as if it hasn t been heated at all it is very difficult to deal with when your baby is crying because he is hungry and you have a bottle that you either need to cool down or heat again i wish that i had bought a different warmer and i would not recommend that anyone buy this one also i have only been using it for only six weeks and the numbers have all worn off of the measuring cup i had to scratch a line into it she has the rest of the books in this series and loves dinosaurs so i figured i found a keeper i got it home and looked at the pictures and they scared me it s totally innappropriate for wee and even not so wee ones in my opinion the dinosaurs are really scary and would virtually guarantee some serious nightmares at our house i returned it without letting her see it i ve now owned an a and the a love the cameras hate the failures my a has failed exactly like other peoples cameras screen goes black pictures go black and now i have no camera are powershots just crappy for longevity honestly the design of these cameras is brilliant but i cannot afford to keep replacing my camera so frequently i got a call from the person i ordered this for saying that the printing was so light it was barely readable it must be they took images and didn t bother to set the contrast high enough or something it was very embarrassing to me to have them get something that apparently is awful this camera is horrible i was going away to live in eastern europe and didn t want to be bothered with looking for a camera there so i bought two two months later the winding mechanism had broken on both of them i was so ticked i thought maybe it was some kind of super fluke but then i talked to some other people who had bought the same camera and their winding mechanism broke too so my advice is spend another ten bucks and by a camera that is going to work for longer than a month do not buy this for your audi a if it s in the range it will not work all a s in these years have the symphony ii with or without bose this will not work for either of those setups but the kit with the two adapters one is red this item has been ordered twice both times adorama sent the m card instead of the m card with the first order i was told amazon caused the problem i waited about a month called adorama but was placed on hold for over minutes thinking the problem must have been resolved within that length of time i ordered from amazon again when the m was sent again more phone calls were made etc this time i was told that adorama does not have the m card only the m although adorama s web site shows olympus m xd cards it is unbelievable that this card is still for sale on amazon s website after another month has rolled by i had great expectation for this sander but the included vacuum adapter was the rs for a mm hose not the rs adapter for american sized hoses the bosch web site says the rs adapter is included but it s not in the package the i m not going to order the adapter at extra cost so it s going back after viewing this tape i felt as if i was trapped on the dark planet the story is limp and aimless with no real direction badly written plot that makes no sense who are all the characters supposed to be i couldnt tell you this movie must have been written by a seven year old the brake hose is not long enough and not work for my mercedes d what i do if you have a previous version of quickbooks any previous version this is not the version to buy it will not convert any previous data and when you go to uninstall it and send it back your old version will no longer work oh and your files will be moved so you couldn t even find them if the previous version did work i hope intuit gets what s coming to them at some point and i hope i m around to see it i bought this to use after having hip replacement surgery the description said that it would fit an elongated toilet seat but it did not fit mine securely at all i attempted to return it because it wasn t cheap but the seller wanted to charge me way shipping which would have cost me almost as much as the item did in the first place so i just donated the seat to an assisted care facility near me i use raw corn in many of my salads and i looked forward to having a handy device to strip the kernels off the cob what a disappointment this gadget is it absolutely mangles the kernels i m back to using a knife which at least produces whole kernels rather than tearing them up or squashing them this movie is plain bad yes good gun fight but where s the kung fu theirs plenty of american made film that are way better in terms of action sequence man even the gun fight in face off was much better then the killer or hard boiled maybe im not into old fashion gun fight like in these two movie i would rather watch a movie like ballistic kiss great gun fight some kungfu and a little special effect i don t care if the killer or hard boil was made or years ago it s just didn t live up to my potential this is the st century i need some special effect i don t understand why some of you people keep living in the past trust me their are way better mivie then these two and were made in the and take for example the god father and much better movie then these two go and recomend this movie for the customer not some lame movie like killer and hard boil as for chow yun fat check out my review for hidden dragon crouching tiger this book was painful i kept looking for some actual reason for the author to have gone to this much effort i just couldn t summon up any sympathy or caring for the characters it was a shallow story about shallower people don t waste your money be aware that if you buy books on the kindle that just as the free wireless can let you download books it also lets amazon remove books from your device when they need want to i purchased the cd for song the irish wedding song it is beautiful outside of this track there are maybe other songs worth listening to when you were sweet sixteen and i love you because this should not be billed as an irish cd very little irish about it it is more country than irish and has very little to do with a wedding my hairdresser recommended this its a waste of money and it is expensive it did nothing for my hair morrocan oil is much better let me start out by saying i loved ruben during american idol and couldn t wait for his album to come out ruben s voice is amazing but the lyrics of his songs are laughable i m sorry for is an example of just a horrible song i was really looking forward to hearing more songs like flying without wings which ruben sings beautifully i hope ruben puts out another album that portrays the ruben we all know and love from the show i purchased this so i can take all my tunes with me like everyone wants to in my area it s hard to find a clear fm station unless its at the extreme lower end of the band the tuner does not have the capacity or capability to tune below therefore in my area at least reception really stinks fm stations still come in loud and clear but very disappointed of the performance of this product but it does charge great so what first of all the one i received was defective the animated scene sticks once every revolution and stops playing it is possible to nudge it with a finger and get it going again by nudging it along i discovered the box s other flaw silent night is horribly abbreviated and doesn t sound remotely right if you were singing it would be silent night holy night sleep in heavenly peace for i didn t expect a symphony but it isn t even worth naturally amazon has an excellent return policy so i am satisfied in getting my money back gigli is not as horrible as people claim it is sure it s bad but i ve seen plenty worse joe dirt national lampoon s european vacation nightmare on elm street freeway confessions of a teenage drama queen house of a corpses bones tank girl ticker belly daredevil not another teenage movie friday the th bill and ted s excellent adventure dead alive ed and his dead mother sprung ringmaster bully titanic i was excited to wear these with a costume this month but i won t be able to they are very sexy and the length of the shoe is true to size but it is very narrow up by the toes and i don t have wide feet shame really they would have been great we received no telescoping pole and the bulb did not heat up at all they sent us another bulb it still did not work we are very disappointed i bought this for my wife january now on a table it s a pile of parts that i m going to throw away my wife only used this machine a couple of times for dumpling wrapper but soon she found the roller mechanism don t work properly sometime stuck she and her friend another lady tinkered with the machine now it s a pile of parts lying on the table that i m going to throw out i guess i m the one to be blamed as i call myself an engineer mummy was kind of fun and the special effects were good but this sequel is pure ridiculous tiring tripe a complete waste of time i stopped it in the middle and went to bed and only watched the rest of it because i d already rented it i don t even give this one star but it won t let me post without one can you give less than one star after ordering the hat i got an email from star struck stating that they were sold out and made an error they continued if you find it in your heart to forgive this blunder and allow us another chance to delight you we would like to extend the coupon below in appreciation of your loyalty and trust the funny thing is that the coupon code they gave me for a whopping off expired months ago also the hat i ordered was and the minimum price to use the coupon code was yeah they delighted me the stryder is basically a bad saves the day clone you de be better off just buying a saves the day cd hell their original bassist even left the band to play in saves the day good call eben by the way if you ever have the chance to see the stryder live don t they are one of the worst live bands that i ve ever seen i found it amusing how this documentary filming seem to catch every tense moment and fighting episode so perfectly being just in the right place just at the right time which makes this movie s unwilling confession scream out velveeta about as fakey cheesey as it comes the first minutes of the film i thought was well done but then the story line filming deteriorated into a bad con man s ploy that left me humuourously thinking are you serious it made me think rambo got lost in the blair witch project i m sure blur were trying to progress or something but here it didn t really work i bought the album on the strength of the three singles tender coffee and tv and no distance left to run which remain three of blur s best songs but i m afraid to say that the rest of the album seems more like pretentious rubbish than anything else it s like kid a radiohead but it doesn t grow on you from a weird experience into an intense emotional one it just stays boring uninspired and more like the strange fair ground music on parklife than end of a century i should have bought the ones i saw at walgreens i thought these were going to be larger than the small size turns out these were very small they arrived in about a month as the seller was in china i would never ever ordered something from china sucks don t bother not worth the money too bad recordings many bad spots requires too damn many words to accept i m crazy about ravenloft but this item isn t so greatfor what i payed for it if you liked domains of dread youprobably won t be crazy for this either it just seems toexplain how you can get a gothic feel to your adventure everytime you play it gives the history of the land and the population of every domain but almost nothing about the darklords most of them aren t even named while domains of dread gave each darklord a story and history nothing is said ofthem in this text the only thing i really liked about this text is that it hails the return of the lich king azlain we also find out who the new darklord of sithicus is if you are a ravenloft fan i m sorry to say you will probably be dissapointed as well after waiting so long for this books release after solaris i promised myself i d never pay to see another clooney movie and i wish i d kept that promise the opening scene was promising then clooney showed up to drive his car for excruciating long minutes before getting out and looking around at three strangers climbing back in his car and driving again the whole movie was like watching your dishwasher go through it s cycles but even that would be more interesting clooney looks ish and he must ve done this movie to be able to have sex with a young woman dvd cover shows him running lol never except at the very end never did the movie explain why his boss wanted to kill him never did it explain why the girl his boss hired to clooney killed her don t waste your money even when it comes out on ppv or dvd sterling silver rainbow moonstone celtic knot earringsfour days before christmas i recieved these earrings the hook for the ear was attached backwards if worn the earring itself with the moonstone would be facing to the back it was very disappointing i was unable to use these earrings as a christmas gift in fact they are unwearable this gimmick didn t work a j jacobs very loosely ties a series of largely unrelated self conscious anecdotes to encyclopedia entries and calls it a book there is no coherent cohesive plot and the micro stories aren t particularly interesting or amusing the author of a year of living biblically is capable of doing so much better too bad he didn t if you are a fan of diane franklin then this movie is definitely a must have other than that there is not much to recommend this movie robert morley is in this movie but is under utilized the movie does not age well it is obvious that this is a s pulp movie weird screenplay fulfilment of the novel hokey noir effort acting none of the actors were at their best aaron eckhart was perhaps the best followed closely by fiona shaw as mrs lindscott from there the movie disappointed the dialogue was very difficult to hear we kept having to put the volume all the way up the plot was confusing especially at the beginning and end when it s most important scarlett johansson was almost likeable but looked horrible and almost unattractive she looked as if she were ill and didn t fit the part at all swank tried her best but did not fully pull off madeline lindscott and josh hartness whose performance i enjoyed in lucky number sleven seemed to sleepwalk through this one i think he was too young or lacked character of facial expressions for the boring slow plotline mia kirschner was entertaining as the murder victim herself in those screentests which were hilarious i love edie she is my favorite songwriter and i have all her and albums as well as new bohemians but the recording on this album is nothing short of unbearable did they listen to it it s awful it sounds like she is singing into tin can instead of a microphone just wondering why loretta lynn isn t included did they forget about the many nominations she has received for van lear rose if they can t get it right then i don t want it i can stand a cliff hanger i can t stand a blatant attempt to steal my money this book is an example drake is the best thing that ever happened to the heorine she s so annoying i can t even remember her name i wish a demon or the dog would just eat her so the book would end don t buy this crapfest of course the bible itself was great i am reviewing this as a pastor within the aog the commentay and the articles written within were very narrow in their theology they were dogmatic on some points that are very debateable even within pentecostal circles the article on wine and alcohol were honestly written with very shameful scholarship the idea that it is sin for a christian to drink alcohol is anti biblical jesus made kool aid mixed wine does not refer to wine dilluted with a lot of water it is different types of wine mixed with spices the dogmatic eschatology was also troublesome the basically preached their pre trib eschatology chart with the same conviction that they preached the divinity of christ there was not more then one point of view presented even int he most secondary and controversial matters beware on this one it doesn t come with any instructions it s only four bolts and a frame so really not a big deal but worse it doesn t come with the piece that attaches between your receiver and the plow if you would like that it s an additional so before buying this piece make sure you know what it is the picture on the agricover site is incorrect you will receive the uprights and four bolts that will be it plan on having to purchase the angling interceptor kit to go along with this why buy a criminally altered version of the real thing ozzy and his manager wife should give credit to extremely talented original bass player bob daisley and drummer lee kerslake alone with guitarist extraordinaire randy rhoads daisley and kerslake were part of the magic that started it all and the reason of ozzy s present fame and wealth anyone who has viewed the star masterpiece of amanda root and ciaran hinds in their portrayal of this love story will surely know how truncated this depiction was poorly done poorly directed poorly acted devoid of any true depth of feeling what a sad portrayal of captain wentworth in particular poor quality reproduction i agree with the other reviewer i played the collection on two separate dvd devices to verify too many artifacts blobs of dust and jerky movements the sound was muddy for films with snappy dialogue these were a disappointment closed captioning was not available a side note i usually check for closed captioning before i purchase a dvd this time i was too enticed by the low price generally inclusion of cc indicates slightly better quality dvd production and no simply turning up the tv volume does not help i knew immediately what was going to happen after i saw through the big surprise i could only sit back and marvel at kevin spacey s somnambulistic performance didn t they have any coffee on that set lots of sound and fury signifying absolutely nothing there are much better movies out there look a little harder you ll find one gladwell deftly squeezes about pages of content into almost pages of book it goes from pretty good to tedious to boring he draws conclusions which are not based on any facts in the book but he states his ideas as if they were absolute truths i gave him stars because the first part of the book was ok don t waste your time and your money the work of a year old without talent phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy inappropriate similies story line is absurd if this were koontz s first novel no publisher would touch it i purchased a leather bound niv gift award bible but was quite disappointed when the bible i recieved was of poor quality plastic and had no study helps over all i recieved a low quality bible and was extremely disappointed i bought the carrier for its pretty colors it was good when my baby was very tiny but as soon as she was months old the weight distribution left me with a sore back and neck i couldn t turn my neck for days i would opt for something more comfortable and forget about what it looks like i am going to make a homemade mei tei instead dear everyone maybe it s only me an advanced computer user for over a decade but after spending many hours trying to pair the device with different bluetooth headsets nothing happened i had to return the product good luck and congrats for those who had better luck it got here ok and appeared to be a new not refurbished model does not work does not spray wand brush attachment does not work even when i wet the area i was trying to clean very little liquid got suctioned up into the dry side it s going back and i m not going to buy another one i don t think it really works that well at all i d rather pull out the hoover steam vac and get the small spots that thing works like a miracle over rated and crappy sound sound same as my monitor speaker on my samsung lcd how sad is that no base no med s no high s just make some noise after reading peoples reviews and i thought with stars worth a try i hook it up for m and took it out and send it back if the price is i would have keep it but i think speakers from swap meets are even better i order a logitech speaker system z and is only dollar more and it sound x better don t waste your time on this crap from bose this cd gets worse every time i play it more grease soundtrack than greasy rock n roll and the band sounds like a bunch of studio banana s rather than a real band cheesey rather than cheeky too fabricated and totally tame personality crisis for sure these songs are weak pop rock for an aging audiance maybe they should have used this recording as the soundtrack to the forthcoming movie bio on the dolls with leo dicapprio starring as david johansen tom cruise as syl sylvain and tommy lee as johnny thunders coming to your local multiplex sooner than later total garbage broke first time used made real flimsy can find many others better then this for sure try others at first i wasn t able to find these anywhere so i ended paying for these i then went to the dollar store randomly and found the exact same bag for i was very disappointed i m a minor fan of the replacements but this solo effort by westerberg is simply sub par and boring although i do enjoy silver naked ladies the only good work he s done since going solo is on the singles movie soundtrack buy that instead i really like jan hammer s work i like his stuff with john mclaughlin al dimeola neal schon and jeff beck i like his solo stuff such as his music for miami vice and beyond the mind s eye but i could not stand this cd i do not know what he was thinking when he wrote this music i was so disappointed i sold the album there was not a single song i liked to justify keeping it i should have known that this product would make me break out the scent is extremely strong people with sensitive skin should avoid this product i ordered bottles of this lotion based on the reviews i gave the lotion to my insensitive friends and they love it i had to return this software because it would not write to an ntfs file system actually the program did write the image file to the ntfs file system i m running windowsxp professional but when i went to verify the contents of the image file with the image explorer utility i got an error message don t buy this program if you need to write to an ntfs file system use norton ghost instead i guess not and that s too bad because that s what this book deserves i can t say anything another reviewer hasn t already said so i ll just sum up some key descriptive words ignorant false ignorant lacking in factual information ignorant faulty logic ignorant mis use of statistics and utterly non scientific did i mention ignorant if an rpg gamer wants a good chuckle by all means help yourself but please pick it up at the library to avoid lining the author s pockets a waste of perfectly good trees discription did not say it was patchwork my friend who wanted it for a gift loved it i wanted to send it back but you get what you pay for i m sorry but this book is bad the sentences run together the dialogue is confusing and the plot line is tired you would do good to waste your time elsewhere go read a real book sadly sega didn t live up to it s good reputation on this one this game is k with some very bad adjustments yeah they put in the new quarterback logic and running back moves but that s about it from there the game faulters very badly the passing game is the most flawed you absolutely cannot complete a pass with any quarterback on any team i have not played one game where i had more passing yards than rushing yards and scored more than touchdowns the ai always picks off your passes or else your recievers drop them however the rushing game is very well done the running back moves look much more realistic and they d have to be since the run will be of your offense all said sega dropped the ball on this one i d say rent it first don t go out and buy it you ll see what i mean perhaps one of the worst books i ever read i kept waiting for it to become interesting but it never did and the main character was not likable at all don t waste your time or money on this book with all the interesting lightly explored topics of world war ii why waste time on might have beens of low probability this was as bad a production as i have ever seen from the history channel the title was misleading i expected people cleaning their files perhaps something on the imperial conspiracy or the impact of the end of the war on the colonial people but not this trash i wish i would have came here and read the negative reviews before i ordered this book buried underneath all of these glowing reviews are a few that were much more appropriate this book is almost like studying german in order to learn english one of the key reasons for wanting to learn about notes scales chords arpeggios etc is to be able to communicate with other musicians like one of the reviews said unless the people you re with know this system it s not going to help i d recommend the hal leonard musician s institute book guitar fretboard workbook by barrett tagliarino it s available here on amazon and is the best written book i ve come across i gave it a quick first read through and everything made enough sense that i fell that once i read it a few more times i ll understand it all thoroughly i had this printer in because it came free with my emachines t desktop computer from best buy it worked for a while but the paper kept going in crooked and jamming then after a while it would not shut off by pressing the power button had to unplug the cord from the outlet just to shut it off then went to change the ink i noticed a piece of plastic from the inside of the printer that had been melted laying inside it also went through ink like crazy never again will i buy lexmark do i recommend this product heck no blades come without even a decent edge and then refuse to take an edge machining of the mini is so poor that engaging of the locking function is darn near impossible buy these knives only for someone you expect to get into a knife fight with in the future you safety and success are certain lord help usi am a follower of christ i am not any religion except under jesus christ as my savior i am feed up with self righteous chritsians this book is in error i have turned to messianic judasism because i relaize christians are ignorant for years my christian church ignortantly celebrated easter and christmas which are clearly pagan and have nothing to do with christ or god even pagans themselves wonder why christians celebrate thier holidays when i looked into the meaning of these holidays it was clear that no christian should be involved with bunnies eggs christmas trees god commands us not to follow the pagan rituals christians are wrapped up in thier rich churches and pagan rituals and they are forgetting the true jesus i went messianic so i could follow the way god outlined with the full benefits of having jesus in my life this book is bitter and not the truth once aganin we have an angry christian spreading lies the low score is reflective of the copy provided on blu ray not the show itself this is one of my favorite shows ever so of course i jumped on the great price for a blu ray copy but my old dvd box set looks better major disappointment i bought these instead of forking out for a steel firewood bin unless you have a keen mind for d it will be hard to explain my problem i had anticipated a foot firewood bin with the support x s on end so that the grain of the wood on the base would support the firewood these aren t designed to allow for that they are designed for the x s to be flat which will warp and break unless they are flat on the ground which defeats the whole purpose of trying to get the wood up off of the ground i ended up having to cut two of the brackets in half and screw them to the uprights to get them to work they may be fine for a garage storage shelf but there are better products out there for an outdoor firewood bin that will be subjected to the weather simply put this is just a boring showy documentary piece the guys are nice to look at but this leave everything to your imagination plus the continual narration drives you nuts while his films of hamlet and henry iv are brilliant this performance was disappointing i am not sure whether he was past his prime or if the part simply did not suit him but the full weight of the king s character is missing another point i found extremely irritating is that olivier mutters his lines on numerous occasions making it very difficult to understand his words it left me scrambling for the remote control to turn on the sub titles unfortunately there is none on the dvd so i was left miserably struggling to understand many passages the rest of the cast were super john hurt especially was electrifying as the fool but overall one to avoid i was disapointed with this cd we had the record when i was a kid an i loved red skeltons little christmas tree which was on the record but not of the cd i bought it for that story i don t mind too much if a movie is poorly written because writing requires talent not just education but this movie sets a bad and unsafe example for everyone who watches it and especially the kids who are its target audience no open vehicle is safe to operate without a helmet and the archaic and ineffective lap belts in this movie only add to the incompetent image of whomever owns the go cart track lack of knowledge about your subject guarantees that a script will be bad practical outdoor survival a modern approach nancy bogen has one of the richest stories in greenwich village history from which to weave her tale however the characters are one dimensional and essentially uninteresting hippolyte s story was entirely unnecessary and added nothing to the narrative the prologue offered tremedous promise and set me up for a fascinating story unfortunately the actual novel did not follow through such a shame i like bill murray but this film is way overrated for it s own good it s not even remorely funny and its drags it feet to the boring end i like bill murray but he can t save this movie i own one of the larger vornado fans and have had it for many years without problems my mother has two of the larger vornado fans that she has also had many years with no issues this smaller version the vornado cr air circulator made in china apparently does not have the same quality of other models i have had it less than two years and only use it seasonally and it just quit working this morning very disappointed as these are not inexpensive fans i don t know what happened to these books but they are a waste of money lately they all have the same boring and pathetic theme firstly usually image is the most perfect fastest horse in the world then some minor incident happens and melanie cries thinking it is impossible to train the horse and gives up then her perfect cousin christina tells her not to give up so melanie tries again the characters are pathetic winey brats when mel s dad buys image she expects it to be a gift to her that is completely unrealistic he did the best he could and mel blew him off i disliked this book very much you are no longer in touch w the characters or even the horses personally i don t even care if image or star ever races again the horses and people have no characteristics that make them likable unless you like spoiled brats like mel and christina the authors need to develop the characters and horses better if they want to keep selling books this product does work but is misleading it is not seperate brewers in one i was hoping to have one side just for tea and the other side for coffee that is not possible the switch does only or cup brewing not left both right plus the switch is mislabeled when you select the picture of cup it brews on both sides when you select the image of cups it brews on the left side and minor dripping on the right side all in all i would have went with a single cup model rather than this i reccomend all to pass this one by not total drek but as a long time admirer of the band and the men in it this wasn t worth waiting year for let alone ten i ve got somewhere in the neighborhood of lc cds in varying types of promos imports live recordings etc and this wins out as the worst single cd of the entire bunch there are a couple of gems flying strikes me as one of the best songs of recent memory but there was little grab upon first listen and even less after my th i don t have a problem with the covers as some do i love their rips in years past through should i stay or should i go sailin on and the ocean amongst others but even the covers seem forced i know these four can do better work even sacred ground a needless repeat from the greatest hits cd of or so years ago sounded better the first time around i just hope this is the accidental b sides album and the real living colour new album will be out soon i remember seeing no cure for cancer on tv in the early s and being absolutely on the floor laughing about a week back after an interval of years and having heard and loved bill hicks s routines since i saw it again and barely raised a titter do read american scream biography of bill hicks to learn about a comic with real integrity who truly played from the heart as he was so found of urging us all to do then see if leary s erzatz imitation does much for you and yes it doesn t look too good that the end of leary s stand up career coincided with hicks s death i say this reluctantly because i have only looked into the matter recently and have actually been a fan of leary for years both as stand up and actor but once you check out hicks s work and look into the facts it s hard to have respect for leary any more the amazing thing is that he got away with it for everybody who wants to become an american war hero the movie is shocking sad and depressing in its honesty about the casualties of war it shows the daily struggles of our finest when they return to their civil life after being sent to one of the playgrounds of america s imperialistic aspirations on the chess board of the greedy ruling elite when they find themselves injured maimed and traumatized for the rest of their lives watch it share it with the young impressionable kids that all tooeasily fall for the heroic rhetoric of our government and its always obedient propaganda machine the corporate media we love the design of this bag if only it was constructed better the zippers on the side pockets were the first to go after only a few weeks a year later we are looking for a replacement for one expects much better i am sorry but this book did not take me any where i would have gave it a but it had a good plot tamora pierce s books do not pull me in they go to fast and don t have enough details i also wish they told more about her brother i would not recomend this to boys for reasons if you read this book you will understand i know many people like it so don t take the book the wrong way i just didn t like it the next series that starts with tricksters queen looks much better even the title is better i had this very same item a couple of years ago but from an other trademark it is easy to use and install this year i bought this one with no razon without fall water touch or bad handling any pc will not recognizes it it is just a piece of junk now and i will need to buy another one in less a month avoid this item choose a more expensive device or something else this product does not have an overpowering smell of salmon and taste wise it was ok it sort of taste like a piece of onion with salt and a bit of pepper i bought this today for the first time thinking it would be great because it was salmon i was wrong very wrong where snack masters losses all it s credibility as being snack masters is in the texture of this jerky how can they expect people to eat this stuff it is very dry rough and sharp if you ve ever held wood bark in your hands then you know what it is like to hold this jerky if you try to snap a piece in half it makes the same noise as if you were breaking a chicken bone i have a headache from trying to eat this stuff and i m expecting puncture wounds in my stomach any minute now if your teeth are made out of knives give this a go if not stay clear taste texture i bought this item thinking it would be a full size seat cover like it shows in the picture the picture is a full size bike it looks like a or suzuki rm the item description says facotry effex all grip seat cover what they sent klx seat cover thats a kids bike thanks for ripping me off i threw out the box and did not open it until i was read to assemble it waiting of seat foam to come in so when i opened it up days later you can imagine how mad i was so no invoice or box left i am now stuck with it and better be sure i will was waiting for the review to come out to write this the padding on this bed is really lacking so my dog for the most part steered clear of it so i planned on putting it in my dog s crate but it didn t even last days before my dog tore a hole in it you d be better off spending your money elsewhere unless you have a very lazy dog who isn t picky about where he or she sleeps i presently only own two angra albums at this point this one and rebirth and i only have one thing to say thank god for edu falaschi fireworks should be a great album but it is marred by the horrendous voice of andre matos the best thing angra ever did was loose this guy the songwriting is strong and the guitar playing is exceptional but each song is held back from being a classic due to the off key and amateurish wailings of the lead singer the production is awefully flat as well surprising since chris tsangarides handled the production duties this kind of music desperately needs strong dramatic production to work correctly and the mix on this one is not up to par however the album does grow on you after repeated listenings so if your a fan of the band you may want to pick it up for the musicianship just imagine what this album could have been if falaschi handled the vocals instead you can get more data from the internet than you can get out of this page book i ordered this cable and it arrived in the mail early today and one side of the cable did not work bought this for pokemon yellow on my gameboy advance sp brando is so bad in this he should be arrested for over emoting the film moves at a snail s pace even for minutes and the big surprise ending is a mere cop out this is just one of many losers brando did in the s until last tango and godfather came along having been very familiar with jacobs work in humorous interviews with fictitious celebrities i was very excited about this cd it turned out to be things that never were initially worthy of release odd sound effects and early fascination with synthisizers and a few very few of the things originally released on the wide weird world album of the past mark myers mention of this on jazzwax alongside the original implied a connection as does the title but there is very little of that here on this overpriced collection after just returing from hawaii i found this dvd not good reshowned several items over and again was done by some one who really should find other work than try to make a dvd its worth approx to me any one want to buy it i would beware not only the camera but of amazon after having this camera for only months we had problems with it we were on vacation in ca and had to buy a new camera when we returned home we could not return the camera optio to amazon because of their day return policy we are now stuck with ditigal camera s not sure what is wrong with the optio but it does not focus for you it is a common problem as stores i call have had the same problems i bought a kodak one and love it even better so be becareful on your electronics from amazon their return policy is stupied and i will never buy anything from them again their loss i lived on shopping with them oh well i just hope i can save people from making the mistake i made caught my house on fire and almost killed my wife and pets as we were asleep just starting the legal process wish us luck tell your friends and family do not buy apex products i confess that i got the knobs for my dog who turned the gas on once but the problem is that i cannot open the things either it takes a fair amount of hand strength to open the knobs i will have to find another solution the idea is fine just not the actual use oh my freakin gosh who the heck does n sync think theyare holy cow they should know by now that their main listening group is girls under the age of do they really need to hear songs about cybersex get real who wants their kids listening to songs like that all the hype was for no good because this song digital get down brings the whole album down i have hardly any respect for the boy bands but compared to this album bsb and deg are angels spend your money on better things and keep your standards higher than a bunch of guys trying to make money off of hormone driven teens cheaply made looks ugly had problems ordering it the manufacter back orders items and then never delivers puts you on waiting list lowers the brand reputation in a lame attempt to make it unavailible and thus seem like a special item or exclusive very unreliable company if i have to wait longer than i should i get angry and usually sever business ties as the persons are not serious about keeping customers happy another example of canadian europe conteporary decor being just hype to over charge for low quality build aesthetics and customer service and satisfaction they are notorious for setting high expectations then and failing to deliver i like the design of the dw handle and the stacked rail system however the motor is so loud and the gears do not seem to be well made also oil drips when in use and the saw blade is poor quality and needed to be upgraded for my first project hitachi still makes the best miter saws the picture was a little misleading because it looks like there are separators between each subject like a file folder the book wasn t nearly as informative as most of the books i have read on the subject sooo disappointed in this book when i read hard eight and was disappointed not only in the length what was it about words but the with plot too i had hoped that maybe ms evanovich had expended her energy on creating a christmas classic with the zany plum characters not so i love the plum series and buy the hardcovers the day they are released i strongly recommend this series to anyone who loves humor plus i d planned on buying this book as christmas gifts for friends too cheap to shell out for the hardcover guess what i m saving my money and hope book nine is redeeming i think janet needs to quit the publicity tours and get back to writing the characters and the stories we all expect i bought this because dr oz said that the best thing for rough hands is jojoba oil but this one has a horrible smell this book was awful i had to read it for a book club and it couldn t be more exagerated blanco claims to be bullied and harrased yet never gives reasons as to why she is treated so poorly this book is not at all realistic for a true story the author herself claimed that her book was rejected some times by publishers you would think that she would realize that perhaps her book sucked but she didn t get the message i am writing this to give the message to all the readers considering this book move on don t waste your time it s possible that it may be my fault i may have misidentified the kind of ants i have but they will gather around it for a moment and then march right past it without ever paying it attention again so i cannot recommend this product as it has not worked for me i wish these sandals had a smooth sole i bought these because i teach ballroom dancing hours a week and my feet need something soft to relax these don t cut it i was very disappointed with this book as a traditional wedding guide it s not bad filled with the basics of wedding planning cutting down your guest list gown shopping reception options etc all wrapped up in a fun little guide however as an anti bride wedding resource not so much while the book toted the mantra of it s ok to be different it didn t offer much of substance other than explaining that not all bridesmaids are wearing the same dress these days gasp that brides sometimes wear dresses other than traditional white holy cow and you can get married in a park crazy talk the wedding planning section was thrown in as an afterthought assuming you d spend the big bucks for its sister book called the anti bride planner if you re looking for off the beaten path ideas for your wedding move along there s nothing to see here length minsthis reflective license plate frame is not at all reflective i installed it on my car and tested it with a head mounted flashlight the two factory installed reflectors on the car reflected back just fine the license plate frame does not reflect back any light at all i don t know if i just received a defective one or if they are all defective like this i also comparaed it to a common bicycle reflector with the lights on both reflectors look the same but with my headlamp turned on you can see in the video that the bicycle reflector really does a great job of reflecting light back while the license frame does almost nothing i m very unhappy with this product compared to the allegedly same product i bought literally decades ago i recycled the old one and on second thought wish i hadn t because i felt i d left it one too many times on the burner without any water in it also it looked very scuzzy inside i knew as soon as i lifted the new one out of the box that it was much more cheaply made it feels lighter and just doesn t look or feel as solid or well constructed all of that wouldn t matter much if it worked ok but it doesn t i can barely and sometimes not at all hear the whistle from the next room my hearing is fine but i really liked the loudness and beautiful two tone train like whistle on my old teakettle i called the company and they very graciously sent me a new whistle but that hasn t solved the problem and i m probably going to just give up i think that once again they just don t make them like they use to a despicable person brown s road to the top is littered with corpses unanswered questions and deceit a true hero for the ages and a new low for america it appears that you can do just about anything and as long as you embrace the left and feminist agendas your position as a voice to be listened to is secure any critics are written off as racist or anti women this book and brown s success are truly disgusting warning the minimum requirements for this game are very misleading the box says nothing about needing a specific video card and you may think your computer meets the minimum but byer beware it probably won t work we have a brand new computer with alllllllllll the bells and whistles and it wouldn t run this game and a video card is not cheap go to the website and make sure your computer has a game card and video card that is compatible or you will be greatly disappointed once again microsoft leaves me sad i probably will think looooooooong and hard before i buy another game by microsoft and to think i once thought nothing would disappoint me more than a sims game i ordered this product month back but haven t received it yet and they say it won t be shipped for another weeks the whole mail in rebate is a fiasco to trap poor customer because you will never receive the product before the mail in rebate offer expires the problem with this book wasn t the writing stross does a decent job working with scant material the problem is that the vcs he writes about are a bunch of pompous idiots who happened to score big when they closed their eyes and tossed darts at their prospect list this book destroyed any semblance of hope i ever had that the capital allocation process is a fair one run by intelligent people who are good stewards of the money they re managing too bad i fear we ll see the results of this vc binge in the coming years thank god i didn t pay more than for this binder this item is pure garbage where oh where do i start first off this is a mess of a movie director leone knows two shots in this film close up and reeeeally close up i watched this film on tv with my family when i was around and we all laughed our heads off during the screening everytime there was a supposed dramatic moment that god awful music would chime in and what s with casting henry fonda as the villain i thought at any moment the aging star s teeth were gonna fall out onto the dusky plains of italy lemme try to put this gently this movie stinks extreme close ups bombbastic music and endless scenes sans dialogue do not a classic make the other reviews of this book are valid ratings johnson tells a good story in the go get em boys style of the s when this was first written the reason i am posting this review is to let other potential buyers know that this ibook is published entirely without any maps or photographs how a company manages to publish a military biography without these is unbelievable for that reason i cannot recommend buying this edition and am giving it star the story is a four however the text of this book has been published many times under other titles hopefully one of them has the pictures that i remember from first reading this in the late s and those are what i would urge the reader to consider they came in an envelope and were all bent the quality is extremely cheap if i had it to do again i would not buy these the notebook in this product is very cheap it takes several minutes to get the zipper started it is worth about i put one star because there was not the option of no stars this cd is just plain awful i agree with the other reviewer on this pink try this cd is better musically than this madonna does not even help this cd at all the entire cd sounds like rejectes from the previous album and some actually some like i m a slave you watched this loser because the leads are two of my favorite actors however should have seen it coming with the teddy bear as the vehicle for delivering this ridiculous piece of fluff can t believe i watched it to the end worst movie ever seen sesame street is better than this way better awfull controls full of bugs ok graphics nice storyline shame because it could be so much better i have ordered a lot of vita coco in the past but something is not right with this last shipment the coconut water has a rotten smell to it the first one that i drank gave me a throat infection and i am still recovering for the ear infection that followed not sure if i should bother returning this or contacting the fda but this shipment is not right i bought two of these for christmas and the eggs from neither pack hached i think this is a rip off beware some good levels some good cars mostly nothing special though if you want a good twisted metal game look elsewhere in teh series if you want a good vehicular destruction game look to vigilante or better still interstate or interstate the suprise success of electronic s debut eventually meant that there had to be a follow up somewhere unfortunately the charm of the debut does not carry to raise the pressure and disc that is more sumner than marr and sounds like a weaker new order album without the hooks raise the pressure misses the added pleasure of neil tennent s guest vocals if that is what you re looking for fine but be warned just about any new order album or for that matter pet shop boys or omd is a better buy some side projects best remain one shots i am a normal lover of the stone barrington books however this installment of the series was not an enjoyable read for me i didn t like the book being in england i m not into reading foreign books i didn t like the character match ups especially stone with monica then sarah then arrington i think it made him look to much like a man harlot i didn t really like the plot of the book yes i understood it just didn t like it thought some of the things going on were too far fetched i like to try to imagine the scenery and what s going in the book in my mind but couldn t do that with this book i still love stone and dino and will give this series another try hopefully the next attempt will be better luc besson is the writer and producer of paris with love but his influence on the director is really apparent at his best besson s films are ravishingly well shot andedited with humor and kinetic energy at his worst his films are boring and repetitive takingone idea and playing it out tiresomely to build a featurelength film la femme nikita is one of the better ones the fifthelement is lots of fun and very imaginative i found the big blue virtually unwatchable the joanof arc movie was overlong by about an hour and sufferedfrom a bizarre tonality even with it s dazzling sets andcostumes travolta has a few opportunities to be fun to watch but thefilm is sadistic and gratuitously violent travolta s characterkills off about people both innocent folks and terroristsand doesn t get a scratch this film owes a lot to john woo style actioners the film makingis competent but the story and script are just dumb i bought this item a few days ago at a local walmart store thinking that it will be easy to upload music and video on but after days i still cannot download one song i did everything short of reinstalling windows media player just one more side note this player frequently freezes up the bar is nice because its wider but its true its easy to bend so its not for any extreme thing best for cruising bikes etc for some reason amazon will list the same product multiple times once for each vendor that sells it this doesn t make any sense as several vendors will end up causing several sections of reviews a potential buyer could easily miss important reviews that happen to be for the same product sold by other vendors here is the link to the other tro s product on amazon but sold by j r black decker tro s slice toast r oven stainless steeli posted a review there that i suggest you check out people do your self a favor and spend your money on something else the decision to buy a product like this one strangely enables the producers and the companies who finance such things to make more of them who needs that why support the claims and findings of a bunch of people who are simply out to make a buck by selling you their version of the truth behind the mystery make no mistake this production is pure fantasy it doesn t even have value as entertainment filler the best thing that we can all hope for is that once the intitial batch has been run that the option to produce more of them will not be excercised at the pressing plant about half of the gloves have holes in the before you even put them on which of course means once you wear them the holes stretch and pretty much make them useless if they are not ripped already they soon will be definitely not mechanic gloves way too thin and cheap lowest quality latex gloves i have ever used though a fan i m quite critical of jay z he has some tight songs for sure but linkin park is music for idiots why take a pretty good track like big pimpin and ruin it with lp what do you expect when you take a song thats already half crappy like izzo and put the worst representation of modern rock behind it sure an improvement for linkin park but does jay z really want his name attached to this piece of dung too late for second guesses i suppose if today s media reports are true innocent until proven guilty all that how sad another icon takes a plunge having been exposed as a phony he can get from schmucks like you me buying his inspirational books for dog lovers according to reports this author who claims to be sensitive to the plight of mistreated animals lives with animals permanently crated well read the news reports i can t write more withoput crying this is the worst camera that i have ever purchased i had a logitech before and so went with the brand name from the getgo i had problems first the software wouldn t load properly after that the camera continuously malfunctioned causing loads of computer problems after five days i realized that i had to return the product to amazon i have since bought another webcam and it works beautifully proving that it wasn t my computer or incompatibility issues but a defective product keith is strange he sets out to destroy the life of a popular bystander at his high school without cause i understand and can relate to the message of opposites attract but it is so hopeless for them that their eventual relationship makes no sense keith was creepy acted to perfection however which was a turn off from the opening credits first of all it took days to receive this shipped from summer rain in china from the time i ordered it i ordered an identical one except in clear not blue from a usa seller luos cultural goods and rec d it in less than a week second it has a large about flaw on one side which is very noticeable and makes it unusable as a gift it s not worth returning so i will try to polish the flaw down with a dremel tool and just live with it very disappointed other than the flaw it is very pretty i have ipods i only listen to music on ipods one in the car one for working out one connected to home stereo i would never ever buy a cd that doesn t let me listen to it on my device of choice seems very very stupid to me i m also shocked that dave matthews would allow greedy suits to do this too totally suxs guess i ll just have to get them on itunes i m using this book to review linear algebra having been away for quite some time the basic text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly explained but the amount of errors in the answers to the exercises are totally unacceptable if i was a teacher again which i was years ago and a student turned in this quality of work for the exercises they would get a failing grade the typos and errors really are that bad i have found that i do not trust the answers given in the book as i am using my computer to do the math to double check my practice i absolutely have to agree with others the book itself is good but the answers to the exercises are so bad that i can not recommend this book which is unfortunate as the explanations of linear algebra are actually quite good i m a huge andy kaufman fan and i was really looking forward to seeing this the only thing worth watching on this one hour show was the elvis impression the other minutes of this one hour show was boring and not funny at all thank god i didn t buy this i m going to rent the midnight special next it has to be better than this dud i used to have the original stereo united artists gotta take that one last ride on track and it sounded much better than this unfortunately some one decided to compile every single track in mono and use the same track listing for this cd if you re a mono purist this is definately the cd for you however if you want to hear jan and dean in true stereo like the original liberty records i would whole heartedly recommond avoid buying products from one way records if they ever heard of more than one way maybe they wouldn t have chosen the wrong way i ordered this dvd and received an empty case contacts with the seller and amazon have not resulted in the restitution of amount paid i purchased this item to replace the poorly designed stock unit that is making terrible popping clunking noises in a suburban prior to this i replaced the steering column bearing to ensure that was not the problem much to my dismay this part did not stop the noise actually when i drive over speed bumps it makes a loud squeaking noise presumably due to a lack of grease in the shaft although it is designed differently it looks almost identical to the stock unit i m now contemplating whether i want to re install the stock one and send this unit back not sure it s worth the or not though although amazon is fantastic to work with borgeson makes a much beefier shaft for this application but i m not sure i want to spend the extra s on this low quality tear easily i ve torn several just getting them on my hands this book is a good crash course with a lot of helpful tips and rules to remember but when it comes to examples or practice test author makes a lot of mistakes what s more author does not explain well why this answers better over others and most of the time when she tries to explain she basically says it s right just because it is right does it make sense no well get used to this kind of explanations because this is author s tactic the hat didnt match the item the color was completely different and not a school color we too were hoping for just yogi bear cartoons although snagglepuss is moderately funny yakkee doodle the little duck is extremely juvenile not especially funny and very hard to understand the dialog the copyright dates vary on each cartoon revealing that these were never actually shows as such but rather a compilation we were hoping for only yogi bear cartoons not just one third of each show this set is a disappointment i though it was just me but after reading several other reviews i see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble disassemble the locks are impossible the items do not quite fit right and it would be impossible to get this thing into its travel bag the mattress is thin and very lumpy each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps i bought this product thinking i could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co sleeper aspect but there is no way i recommend you avoid this product i would call myself an expert gamer this game is terrible really i ve owned about systems over the years and i can tell you this game doesn t at all relate to some of capcom s other triumphs such as devil may cry or onimusha warlords for ps terrible game expecially the controlls capcom should have taken advantage of the feather soft feel of the gcn controllers oops better luck next time guys out of i have not found this to be reliable in switching on at degrees i am unable to trust the product you know the multitude of requirements which make actually getting the rebate shouted about in the large print so improbable watch out the title says it all if you bought this player for listening to audiobooks which is what i did you ll be extremely disappointed that you ll have to fast forward through the book every time you start it up since there is no resume feature considering audiobooks are anywhere from to hours long in most cases or at least the pieces you get from audible are it s totally inconvenient to start playing from the beginning each time you turn it on get used to the fast forward button and remembering exactly what time you were at because you re going to be doing a lot of it lame i love the design and concept of this pump however the fuse will blow very easily then the whole thing is trash my husband is an electrical engineer so he tore the thing apart and added a new fuse twice but it still keeps blowing fuses so as nice as it is it s really just an expensive paperweight stay away i m looking for a pump now that will actually do what it s supposed to do well reading through these reviews i figured hey doesn t seem bad rarely have reviews been so wrong where do you i even start i don t want to make too much of it because my stars should pretty much speak for themselves but there is nothing new in this at all there is no innovation you pretty much hear the same riffs and powerchords in every song they all kind of run together and blend unfortunately with a non cohesive overall experience i guess i should have known what i was getting into i m glad i have motorhead s inferno to get me through the disharmony that american idiot left in my mind sure made me feel like an american idiot when i bought it the only reason i gave it stars is the fact that i definately have some listening bias and although this would appeal to some you re all better off just burning it and saving your money for something good like motorhead s inferno or megadeths the system has failed the crown what you set the time and date with fell off the watch within weeks of wearing it returned watch for warranty work but will not have it back for at least a month i just open the box pulled the bins out they are chipped and cracked the wood is fake made form cardboard and peeling at the bottom received it yesterday want to return it for a new one got it for my son so he can learn organization i rate it as poor quality the jewelry box that comes with this set is a piece of junk the drawer won t stay in and forget about the clouds staying on it s pure frustration unfortunately my daughter got it as a birthday gift and we didn t get a gift receipt so i didn t even know where it came from we ended up throwing it away don t waste your money you can buy the pony separately in his day in age you would think that men would have some more respect for their female counter parts the authors of this book should take a good strong look at themselves and ask where the hell did our lives go sooo wrong goodman and sexton should be locked up with people like howard stern their book is nothing more than nasty tips from a smooth talking casanova who only has one thing on his mind sex do not buy this book it is merely a tool used to get sex disgusting i don t understand why but this game has changed since i was a kid the concept and game play is the same but the board is terribly laid out my young children cannot figure out which direction to go and frankly i have to look very carefully in order to help her the game takes a long time to play and often we get confused about direction and such because the board is so busy and cluttered i think chutes and ladders could use another revamp i wish it was easier to play like the version i remember from my own childhood maybe the wood was in a high humidity area near the coast but this was really hard to fit together despite rubber mallet and a real hammer be prepared to have the neighbors complain about the banging if you live in an apartment while it does say natural the picture suggests the big pieces have some sort of finish but it is bare wood would not buy again but in its favor can be configured in other formats pretty easily ps the narrowest cabernet bottles can slip between the big pieces most of the episodes are repeats from other seasons they should not have priced this last episode as high as the others and or informed the fans customers about the fact that it was a rerun of other seasons this is very disappointing it seems that they were just out to make money i really liked this bag but the shoulder strap has a cheap plastic connection which broke after a month of use if you plan on using the shoulder strap i d pass on this bag i got this toy cause i always wanted a rc plane i launch it and it did not even fly i get it working theres no wind and it looked like a ragdoll in a angry pitbulls mouth save your money get a real flyer jim hinkson s books are generally good however they are for box lacrosse the indoor version of the game box lacrosse is not that popular in the us where field lacrosse is the dominant form of the game if you re looking for something on field lacrosse look at lacrosse fundamentals for winning sports illustrated winner s circle books or lacrosse technique and tradition i agree with the other reviewer who disliked the unusual writing style in this book this book does seem like an experiment in writing style for the author as she starts with a straight forward regency but quickly involves literally a half dozen or more characters who are matchmaking for the worst reason too keep a job the style is so off putting that i couldn t finish this book and quit it almost halfway in the book deals more with secondary characters and this spoils the storyline not recommended no stars this movie needed a little more to it it seemed like it was going to become really interesting throughout the movie but just kind of stays in the same place would not recomend it i only finished this book since it was a book group selection i found the tone condescending to women and the almost stream of consciousness writing style not conducive to making his points i would have liked it better if the author cut out about pages i did enjoy flashing back to the clinton era and being reminded of the events that caught our attention at the time this is the first psp game i bought and about games later still the worst i have never played a game as simple as this one there are toms of weapons and the graphics are descent but there is nothing that would make you want to continue i would honestly rather play pong with myself wow such fervent devotion to a hollywood picture of course jesus spoke to mel gibson and gave his script writers enough material to fill a long movie hmmm my bible certainly doesn t have all those details but i m not mel gibson i can t sucker hoards of people to worship at the alter of the big screen did you ever ask yourself the question what would jesus do if he saw this good question since he was there and mel gibson wasn t for those of us who really are devoted to jesus and read the bible this movie is an atrocity oh well go out and buy the dvd if you think it represents our lord and while you re at it buy the passion stationary kit too it s being sold at walmart no rock has been left unturned for the profit mongers i got a good price on this so i ordered it for my baby for christmas she hardly touched it i thought maybe she was too old but she was firmly in the recommended age range after swiping at it a few times and pulling it once at my insistence it drifted to the corner never to be played with again i gave it to the goodwill in like new condition i think that it is easy to get kids interested in anything that sounds like it comes from the radio that is the key with this there isn t any trick to the learning just singing the facts adapted to rap songs by artists such as cent tupac and ludacris i found the video a little troubling the pieces with the girls wearing half shirts and exposing the strings to their panties i think is a little over the top for an educational video kind of a shame the book was written by a ghost writer and was still poor when people like this big mouth ignoramus get elected to state office you know it s about all over truly depressing his book now costs one cent and it is still over priced why anyone would buy a book pertaining to photographs that contains no photographs is beyond me i feel that amazon sold me this item under false pretensis it seems that anything that is supposed to have pictures and is on kindle has somehow lost the pictures in the process of digitizing it shame on amazon this item is not as described it is plastic is described as primarily die cast metal i agree the detail is good and the chamber trigger mechanism nice but was expecting at least die cast metal if you want this replica and don t mind it being plastic you will like it if expected the discription then you will be disappointed like me as a thriller this book is certainly serviceable albeit formulaic kennedy knows how to set up a scenario halfway through the book i found myself empathizing with ned but the pacing of the last half of the book was off as if kennedy got tired of his own story the thing about torke is that he tries too hard to get people to like him furthermore his rationale albeit honest in his intentions of departing from academic views on composing vernacular polyglot works is superficial and artistically light weighted this vacuum worked like a dream for about months and then constant clogging and cleaning and loss of suction i had to throw it away really after just two months high don t recommend this vacuum very aggravating experience and a waste of money and ps hoover really doesn t care about it s consumers either i suggest something else like a dyson maybe so far they have better overall ratings k the text as written certainly succeeds with many in my case i got the message after or repeats of the growth mindset can do it theme as story after story repeats the same theme which is a good message i began wondering when some background exploration would begin it never happened i ve read other works by dweck she plays the role of editor in the recent handbook of competence and motivation in this book the two mindsets are called fixed and incremental it is very academic and technical but a treasure trove of insights i liked it so much i m going through it again with a fine tooth comb i d check mindsets out at a bookstore or library if you find yourself wanting more take a look at dweck s other books i have three of these in my house all bought in september of one of these was replaced within the first year and the replacement doesn t work at all now i swapped out batteries from a phone that does work so i know that it is not a problem with the batteries another phone now has so much static when in use that it is untolerable to listen or talk using that phone the third phone works great for a minute or two and then it just goes dead initially i was very positive about these phones but now i have nothing but a bunch of crappy phones that cost me several hundred of dollars it s ironic that they all seemed to have problems shortly after the one year manufacturer s warranty expired if you risk buying any of these handsets the extended warranty might actually make sense since the product has such poor quality ingredients corn syrup solids vegetable oil including palm oil junk i m a huge fan of nora roberts and this book was so disappointing there is no way this book is a new release it is very awkward and doesn t have her usual great plot it doesn t even flow like a nora roberts novel this would have been a fantastic winter toy for my and five year old children but of course it was too good to be true the first bouncer had three pinholes in the nd tier near the spears yes amazon was helpful with the exchange but the same problem existed with the replacement but only in the third tier each time it was very hard to find the leaks always around the seams i would not reccomend this model unless they ve improved the craftmanship around the seams this item should only take minutes to inflate wth the recommended electric pump if it is taking longer start running your fingers around the seams feeling for the leaks good luck i had a philips norelco xl which served great for years until the guard comb eventually broke bought this one and hoped it would as good no way this thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves the power switch and head release buttons are next to each other so i kept pushing a wrong button the comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there no surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses the hair length scale is on the wrong side the power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless imho all in one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function awful product terrible engineering shame on philips i do not care of its low price i would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one i have a front carrier and this sling it is comfortable across the back but i feel like i have to hold the baby while she is in it i also feel like she gets balled up i have only used it a few times and she has fallen asleep in it so i guess it is comfortable enough it does have adjustable straps but i feel i am a bit too short to use it i am not sure how women with large d or larger breasts would like it i just feel awkward using it ok i don t have this doll i won t buy this doll if i ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this i saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for and i almost fell out of my chair this doll is in appropriate for someone under the short skirts the short tops how the heck can mattel think that this was a good idea i m years old and i would never dress like that nor would i allow my child to dress like that bottom line shame on you mattel if i could give anyone a comparison small is like a size in ladies apparrel and the medium is like a size the medium is to big for my larger chinese crested who weighs pounds and the small is too too small for my smaller chinese crested whose waist is inches so both i purchase were a waste i will have to attempt to make the myself i will have to donate them to the humane league plain and simply it doesn t cut well don t waste your money go for a cheaper one that will work just as well or better or go for a better product that would be worth it my favourite record as a young stripling was a crackly worn out black vinyl pressing of we re only in it for the money so when this disc came out in or so i snatched it up but what happened to my memories fz remixed it into a mess what a disappointment i waited another decade to buy the less butchered but still wrong version we re only in it for the money that finally replaced this i still have both i gave it one star but that s only for lumpy gravy for which i haven t such a sentimental attachment we re only in it for the money in this remix gets zero stars not polite to speak ill of the dead but what the was fz thinking when he created this mess actually this is not a kinda music to spend ur money normally the fire within an artist will gradually tend to loss as he gains name fame and money but in s case its too early his new album is not in anyway like his previous album get rich you might have heared the chart leading singles such as disco inferno and candy shop just dont decide after hearing that because those two were the only good songs of the album that leaves us only outta even including that gun shot intro so that was the real reason behind givin our a single star regarding the production its as usual very weak since dr dre is the producer y dont they changr him and reg the feat its nuttin new cause in eminems album will do some feat work and vise verza overall this album aint worth ur money by the way i simply can t tollerate that piggy bank track man oh man hot dog i can t wait for part where we see how the utopian word full of movers and makers groovers and shakers fulfill their potential to the brim and the results that come from this world wait it has already been released oddly enough it was before part of the film was even finished its called bioshock i have read and enjoyed all of hoag s novels until kill the messenger the vulgur language and crude descriptions of characters really spoiled this book for me i got through the first pages wincing and cringing as i read and then took the book back tami you can do it without all that vulgarity it is really a turnoff sadly this is pretty crummy tea for decent orange pekoe i remain sold on typhoo this book is useless i read that it s the online help printed but it s much worse it can t be used because it lacks an index and of course a search option it s a waste of money that you won t even be able to sell later you can buy a bigger size and cheaper at target or walmart for the same price including tax here is totally over priced i bought this cage for my three teddy bear hamsters grumpy speedy and lazy so can i just say this really sucked because my hamsters are not big chewers but they chewed the bars they also would poop and pee in the ball and there is no way to open it i wouldn t recommend this product do waist your money i ordered this and tried using it when i mixed it with my developer it just turned into liquid and smelled nothing like hair product i still proceeded with the process and it did absolutely nothing a couple weeks later i tried it again and same thing so i contacted the sellernancys beauty warehouse inc and they told me that it was too late and that maybe i should contact the manufacturer or read my directions wow i have been doing my own hair for years i think i know what i m doing or else i wouldn t be buying a bucket of hair bleach so i went to sally s and bought the same products and guess what it works it s amazing i don t leave it on too long at one time but even in the little amount of time i have it on it bleaches beautifully since i do have dark hair i have to reprocess it and when i do it comes out amazing so i m guessingnancys beauty warehouse gave me an expired or fake product i should have read the other reviews i was expecting beautiful full color pictures like the cover art since the same illustrator actually did the cover it seems like a very unfortunate editorial decision to not create a full color picture book when i first received the tree of life i actually thought there had been some sort of printing error the unfortunate blue purple color reminds me of old mimeograph sheets i chose a picture book rather than a text because i wanted inspiring art and this just doesn t do it unfortunately the sample doesn t show enough of the book to realize how monotonous both figuratively and literally the pages actually are buyer bewareyou need to have a specialized television to get this product to play dvds that are not region and once you have found that out you are not going to have a lot of luck asking for a refund there are many cheaper dvds available on the web that do not require a multi region television this item was also shipped to me with a european plug does what it says it will do the guards are a little difficult to get on and off the head seems to fall apart easily seems like the materials it s made of could be a little better especially for the price but it got the job done update went to charge it up left it on the charger for over hours the thing barely turns on cleaned the contacts and charged for another hours no change still dead it s in the trash now it s the only book i could find on the subject and it was a disappointment if i learned enough to make it worth the it was just barely a large part of what is said is rehashing what is intuitive and there is very little insight beyond that the title leads you to believe that it is for beginners and i guess that is true for the most part but a beginner will struggle with the installation instructions the book gives in the past year i have purchased two braun blender replacement blade assembly parts because the teeth keep on breaking from what i read this is not a new problem i would not purchase another braum blender because of this design defect if you like reading about bratty over privileged girls then this book is for you the ending was a complete cop out it disguised the fact that the author emily barr was suffering from burn out i won t put the spoiler in this review let s just say that it was an all too convenient way to wrap things up whatever you do don t call this music this is simply crap with a bunch of screaming over it i can t even believe this horrible artist is experiencing success right now the only reason is because of her idiotic tv show pretty soon people are gonna grow tired of her stupid act and stop supporting her she certainly doesn t have the music or talent to back her up the only thing she s doing right now is acting stupid and ruining a bunch of beautiful songs from other artists do not buy this piece of crap that s being passed off as music you ll highly regret wasting your money on this atrocity the battery died the same day and it says that it has multiple power levels but it only has one this is the worst game ever it is very very slow and the hands take forever to flip over on the screen the multi hand games are really bad and don t pay out as much as the regular games why would you want to play multi hand poker and have it pay out less royal flush is only worth than the single hand don t waste your money or your time with this game being familiar with most of melissa s other albums i was dissapointed with don t cry out loud while the title track is a great cut the rest of this album is basically s style r b soul filler the production and arrangements here are horribly dated sounding every bit like a late s period piece on a positive note it is good to finally see her old arista albums being reissued on cd and i am looking forward to the reissue of melissa manchester and hey ricky which should be out by early with bonus tracks these were of melissa s best albums i would also recommend singin which is currently available as a japanese import we got this electric teakettle for our wedding gift and we loved it at first it s nice looking and worked well but i kid you not it just stopped working for absolutely no reason and we are just outside our year warranty on the thing almost like there is some hidden mechanism inside to break as soon as the limited warranty is up we wrote to the company and they offered a discount on a replacement seriously the thing is brand new don t spend the money on this one just buy a cheap one that way if it breaks at least you didn t spend that much photocopy of original and copies are much smaller than page they are printed on i don t consider this book a very good reprint it is a waste of paper save your money content is good but a poor copy don t recommend i purchased this movie from a amazon seller and right now am trying to resolve the issues i have i couldn t wait to get this and now i m sorry i wasted my money on it there are no new ideas here and the book is simply dull given india hicks pedigree i expected more spark and flair than this what a disappointment the tv series bears almost no resemblance to the book a few character names are the same and the carrie and mr big characters are drawn roughly the same as the tv characters all i can say is that the tv scriptwriters did an outstanding job at developing the series well rounded characters from this mess of a book there is virtually no plot or character development the book is a collection of seemingly unconnected short essays in interview format bushnell owes a debt of gratitude to the screenplay writer who was genius enough to take her twisted mess of words and turn them into the scintillating story that we know from the series if you plan to use the drive as a backup don t it has been running fine for about a year now and then all of a sudden it started having problems when turned on it would show up usb for an instant then go away and would repeat this for possibly minutes eventually it would calm down and either be available or not until i power cycled it and the whole thing would start over again the point of this is at under a hundred bucks you get what you pay for it was a good backup until about a week ago if you plan on using the drive as a working drive and you don t mind a failure e g you ve got everything on it backed up then caveat emptor why does gheorghiu try to sing something that obviously she can t sing i think she tried to approach to these new rols on her way but with the worst results her gilda sounds as she was married with children and a dog what kind of gilda is that of course a fantasy almost a nightmare for instance i think the way how she approached to the leonoras and aida it s good i like gheorghiu s voice but it looks as her worst enemy has choosen her repertoire for this cd the same thing happens with her new cd again her enemy told her she is able to sing colarotura repertoire i ordered two of these and neither one would charge or power on i loved the fit and the choice of the over the ear pieces but i never got a chance to test the earpieces because they never worked i m returning them for a refund tomorrow i don t even want an exchange this phone was a total disapointment it looks pretty but was not worth the money for sure texting was a pain and with it being a european phone text the number was not an option being in the us using this phone it would drop my calls and half of the time it would say no signal or no carrier i would have to shut down my phone and restart it also you can not find any software to use the mp player sent the phone back within the first month it s md s like those who poisin the world i m not saying there aren t bad chiropractors but usually wise people learn to discriminate rather than generalize i suggest the author take a serious look in the mirror i had great expectations for this book i thought the idea was great i began reading it and it wasn t long before i began skimming pages the characters doesn t feel real and it feels like the story doesn t move forward from where it starts i mean is good that we are given a look back to know what happened to these characters to know where they come from and why tey are what they are but it somehow doesn t feel real i don t know if it gets better because i just stopped reading it after a couple of chapters i thought it would be nice to read the book before going to see the movie however after reading the book i do not want to see the movie at all there are a lot of cheap thrills in the book the play on bodily functions while funny is dull after awhile duddit s cancer and down s syndrome seem somewhat overly dramatic like the book is trying too hard plus by page i cannot help but feel stupid for reading the book nothing in the book is fresh or imaginative the emotions that are supposed to be stirred up are unconvincing and uninspiring although the plot is interesting enough for me to want to find out what happens at the end i feel like i wasted a lot of time reading all pages of it when i finished it if you are a stephen king fan this may satisfy you however if you are not a fan don t bother this should not even be classified as a book it is more like a pamphlet and it contains old poorly presented stories and jokes a very weak product not worth the money i spent getting it disappointed that amazon would carry such shoddy stuff if these blu rays feature the versions i strongly recommend you do not buy them because the versions were a rush job resulting in messed up picture and audio and changes that were made at the last minute if by some miracle these problems are corrected including properly filming hayden for the end of return of the jedi instead of just using bad stock footage of his head then this set may be worth my time so wait and read the reviews before you buy this if these blu rays are not improved from the releases would you really want to lay down the money for a substandard product from a company that is capable of so much more otherwise seek out the or releases that have the unaltered versions included out of all the demilles this one was a struggle to read too many characters lots of irish lingo confusing right from the start read any other demille and you will be better off i have read them all and this is my least favorite stick to word of honor charm school plum island and the gold coast you can t go wrong with any of these very disappointed with the amount of cleaning required and it s a messy job condensation builds in the grinder with each use causing excessive accumulation of ground coffee that sticks to the inside of the grinding chamber and other places even whole beans will stick to the side of the chamber you have to take the grinder out and wash it water alone will not do it though you have to wipe the remaining residue away with a paper towel say good bye to clean finger nails have owned a few self grinders none of them came close in maintenance the basket chamber also has a cheap plastic construction recommend against i like this mic tried it out while playing games the other day and people said it was clear the mute button is pretty cool and the button lights up green so you know when you are on seemed to pick up pretty well during a pretty chaotic game no complaints other than my playback from skype seemed a bit more bandwidth limited than i would have liked but that was probably skype deign it for transmission speed reasons edit i now think this mic is horrible i have bought a webcam to replace it and realize that this picks up very little and is hard to use you basically have to have your mouth right on the diaphragm for it to pick up anything useable would not recommend i purchased this phone for my father who has difficulty hearing on a regulartelephone although the volume is loud any background noise is very disturbing while talking on this phone the phone has three tone settings along with volume control at higher volumes the tone settings really don t make any difference because he still can t hear because of poor voice quality this phone is supposed to be hearing aid compatible my father can here on this phone better without his hearing aid and on a much lower volume than the phone is capable hopefully there will be a learning curve associated with using this phone but for now it is not worth the money my expectations were that he would be able to pick up the phone make a few adjustments and easily be able to have a normal conversation without a lot of effort it is just not there yet it has been about a month maybe time will tell do not buy the shark portable steamer under any circumstances the trigger mechanism is defective and fails after a few uses causing all of the steam to leak out uncontrollably which is also exposes the user to a possible steam burn euro pro operating llc does not stand behind its products they will not sell you a replacement trigger or hose assembly if it fails and trust me it will fail instead euro pro wants you to spend shipping minimum repair charge to even look at it replacement parts are an additional charge i can buy a competing product for the cost of euro pro s minimum repair charge shipping charge parts charge euro pro s service after the sale stinks i will not buy shark products or do business with euro pro operating llc ever again is it really watts dual subwoofers or is it a watt subwoofer box enclosure please explain would like to know my baby loved baby mozart and baby einstein so i expected the same quality of entertainment from this video sadly we were all disappointed especially my bored baby the whole video seems amateurish in comparison with the other videos even the puppets look sloppy and improvised my baby loved blah the dragon from baby mozart but he does not have the same appeal here he is poorly puppeteered and looks more like a pretty sock than an animated character also julie clarke s nasal voice throughout this tape is grating and does not do justice to the poems recited the red light has blinked indicationg a kill on about different occasions there has never been anthing in the trap this thing is a waste of money the software installed easily i soon discovered that many advertised features did not work with outlook franklin has since upgraded the software with a patch available on the internet i recently upgraded the software which has now turned hot sync into a nightmare addresses are deleted from my contact list bogus entries titled unnamed are entered into my palm some appointments are deleted some are duplicated i am on the verge of uninstalling the software and using something else don t waste your money and time buy something else i received a free sample of these with purchase of some opi nail polish these wipes are just the worst when you try to place polish remover upon one they are not absorbent like cotton pads so the chemical gets all over your hands they are terrible at removing polish as they can t hold hardly any chemical if you want to see what these are like cut a x square of paper and try to use it with polish remover on your nails not too effective really i d rather have some lint obviously i would never buy these and will be tossing them into the trash too bad i find it very odd that people are rating this item and it isn t even released yet the rating of the item should be about the season s dvd not the season itself until it is released ignore these other ratings they aren t about the collected season for all we know the dvds could come out and be real crappy had several of these pens and they all had the same problem the ink just wouldn t get down on paper no matter how i held the pen it would work normally for a couple of sentences and then would start only delivering the ink intermittently would not buy again i bought and tried this on my nikon d and d then sent it back and bought the nikon part mc that costs more than times as much issues the cheap cord s screw in collar would not screw into my d no matter how hard i tried although it did screw into the d the nikon cord screwed easily in the cheap cord is tightly coiled which means it won t extend to anything close to its advertised length the nikon cord is straight finally the cheap cord has a very flimsy switch with an uncertain initial position the nikon has a solid switch that with a solid feel electrically the cheap cord seemed to work ok no idea if it would hold up with use so i strongly recommend spending the money for the nikon mc it has the worst graphics out of all of the games i own it is kind of fun when you first play it for the first time then it starts to get boring you stop playing it and it is like it disappears you only play it for about minutes once a month or even once a year this is the nd b d hand mixer for me it is the last the first mixer was my husbands before we got married the mixer was in new condition and had very little use i used it from time to time for small jobs it froze up it had lots of power but seemed to fall over when the beaters were on it causing it to turn on almost broke my fingers this happened several times i purchased a nd mixer because of the power but the same things happened the mixer froze up b d refused to honor the warranty several times this mixer fell over turned on almost cut my fingers off i sincerely feel this mixer is a danger i do not recommend this mixer for safety reasons as well as performance reasons the service was horrible my book never came they never responded to my messages they sent two automated responses telling me to wait but no personal message telling me what happened the tracking on amazon didn t work at all i believe it s because they didn t even have the book i read some of the negative reviews and all of them sounded like what happened to me do not use this seller this stands as a testament to the mediocrity and imbecility of lenin as a philosopher it is a overtly lengthy dull and plodding work lenin demonstrates that he has little of the flair of a born philosopher but the heavyhandedness and arbitrariness of a politician this book which is so antiquated that it now seems unworthy of even academic interest is nothing but a compilation of quatations from previous marxists glossed and re worked to back up official party policy also includes a typically stupid and blustering polemic against the majority of positivists and idealists who are all deemed as blockheads only the revelations of marx and engels as lenin seems to think contain the monopoly of infallible truth a laughable example of the dogmatism and intolerance of an ideology upon which was founded a totalitarian darkness that could not maintain itself without resorting to terror persecution assassination sabotage and institutionalised ignorance that stupid thing didn t even fit my tire worse buy yet i don t recommend this product if your a true biker p usually i have good experiences with toshiba s products for example i have a toshiba dvd player that i am very happy with however this digital camera was a disappointment in almost every aspect a minor gripe was the short battery life but that s a very common problem with digital cameras in general major problem this camera has a very hard time focusing in low light situations unless you re in a brightly lit room or outside on a sunny day your pictures stand a good chance of being out of focus major problem i owned this camera less than six months when it refused to recognize the existence of batteries i tried many different types of fresh batteries but it says they re all dead now i have to look into getting warranty service if i had it to do over i would have invested a little more in a higher quality camera and a brand other than toshiba you really do get what you pay for when it comes to digital cameras the pro s of this tub are it is inexpensive it is very compact and folds up small enough to fit in a small space if space is an issue this tub is great the con s of this tub are my baby weeks old loves to kick when she is bathing her little feet get caught in the space where the tub folds this is a significant safety concern you can t fill the tub very much with water the water leaks out of the joints where the tub folds it can get quite messy if you have storage problems i would recommend purchasing this tub however the mess of water all over and her little feet getting jammed in the joint space do not make this tub a recommended item we will be purchasing a new tub soon the printing is of poor quality some pages are genuinely difficult to read since i was unable to view pages on the website i was unaware of the print quality i would choose a different edition if i had it to do again i have ordered a dvd to play in australia however they only play sound and there is no picture i complained several times but nearly two months later nothing has happend to replace it got one reply that they will look into it never heard anything again not happy won t buy again i have to rate this item with a minimum of star it should not get any stars i have also bought a dvd lion king the movie dvd has the same problem the second extra dvd with songs is good how odd once you have bought from amazon there is no way you will get your money back or a replacement if goods are not up to standard i bought this recorder a couple months ago and the darn thing broke it ate our cd wouldn t open the disk tray and then we couldn t even get a video feed through it i would recommend not buying this dvd recorder for your own safety this is a decent but mostly run of the mill film i was fairly interested in how the plot line would resolve itself but hugely disappointed in the incredibly simplistic and clumsy manner in which baines the butler was exonerated furthermore none of the characters stood out to me as anything more than typical murder mystery types had baines shot himself when he took the gun from the drawer it would have made for a much better ending i switched from using an avon product to using this product to see if there was a difference there was this product made my skin look worse and was not worth the money also seemed to leave little silicone like flakes on my skin i went back to avon dr rieux the main character of the novel moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner he goes thru the motions of doing his job while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague i find jose saramago s blindess to be a far superior book to the plague similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving the plague was clinical in its approach almost bloodless i found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re read often having to re read many pages over and over i would pass on this book i have yet to receive this movie item what is the delay it was ordered back in december before christmas after reading this book i hardly remember what it is about perhaps this is b c i almost fell asleep while reading it the characters were disgusting and the plot quite boring i didn t even care what happened to them to compare this book to bronte as someone has in a previous entry is a shame hoffman is nowhere the level of bronte to do so she would actually have to be readable water easily gets trapped underneath this mat i bought this mat because it was large enough to hold two very large feeding bowls for my german shepherd i couldn t find another mat that size that could contain a mess the water trapped under the mat has caused my wood floors some damage i am currently looking for something better this book was labeled nearly new which it is clearly not looks water damaged on the bottom and there is a large sticker on the cover very disappointing this movie was the dumbest comedy i have not fully watched my girlfriend and i left the theater about halfway through after not laughing once he was painfully unfunny too bad chris farley died because his career isnt going too well without him if anything get tommy boy instead these headphones lived up to all my expectations but then after a few months the left side stopped working it s not great to listen to music from the right side only why exactly is this edition limited are there really that many people who want to pay an extra ten bucks for a cheap plastic bubble eyed ralph wiggum face thing at least they didn t have the cheek to call it a special edition the descent into shameless shoddy cheapness continues with yet another collection of accordian boxed crud speaking of crud as john madden once said in sunday cruddy sunday in retrospect it was sort of a rip off what a way to treat the loyal fans who have put up with so much nonsense from this franchise amen john i do not actually have this product so i am not giving the product one star i am simply giving this item one star because it is falsely advertised the picture amazon shows is of three products the keyboard rest the mouse rest and the wrist rest now i assumed that since thats what they show thats what i would get well i called amazon they could not verify what i would actually get instead they gave me the number to the products manufacteror they confirmed to me that it is one product only the keyboard rest so if thats what you are looking for go ahead and order this item but if you are looking for a set keep looking the display on the sportrak color is very poor i d take a sharp b w display over this any day it is unreadable on the dash of your car unless it is dark and the backlight is on the battery door is really flimsy too there is only a small plastic tab to keep it closed instead of a screw or something more trustworthy like on the sportrak pro waterproof maybe the unit works great my son was about one when we bought this for him he had zero interest in using it as it is made to be used the balls were all over a couple are missing now and the hammer is mainly used for other things we thought he would grow into it but at two and a half he still has no interest in it s real function for around the same price we could have gotten a more interesting plan ball hammer toy that he would have enjoyed more the lcd was broken when the product arrived one of the numbers would not display aside from that the product felt very cheap i guess if it had arrived in working condition it would be worth the six bucks hence the stars but i had to go buy something better this alarm clock radio purchase was a great disappointment this is not the quality we have come to expect from a reputable company such as sony had no effect on my lb puppy car was filled with the wonderful smell of lemon the dog smelled wonderful but he barked my ears off we had folks check the collar placement everything worked but the barking never stopped i was really excited to get this mp player when it got to my house i couldn t wait to put my songs on it alot of people liked it too but a couple days later my play button got like jammed which was annoying to me then maybe a day or two later something became loose in it and when ever you move it that thing shakes around this is extreamly annoying and i cant even take it out anymore you might be blaming this on me but i would barely let my brother touch it so i would not buy this mp player go to some company that people actually know visual land god id rather have an ipod right now amazon is sending a replacement due to the escape light not functioning upon arrival will see if the replacement experiences the same issue update second unit has the same issue horrible build quality i looked for a long time for an educational piggy bank and thought i had found a tool to teach my six year old about money unfortunately when it came time to take the money to the bank i had to help him get the bills out with tweezers and tape the torn ones also had a very hard time explaining the difference between invest and save just not a concept a year old can grasp the real shame is it made form two pieces of plastic glued together i bought two of these and both broke apart frankly for the i paid for this the free one i got from my credit union works just fine don t waste your money the elastic wire inside the leather weave on one side broke your belt basically becomes a slinky at that point took me a while to figure this out and the time for me to return it elapsed loved the belt bad design i was expecting at least a few laughs but this movie is not funny at all i expected it to be crude and obnoxious but still thought it would be entertaining like the hangover or bridesmaids nope i was so bored with it i eventually turned it off i bought this book based on other customer reviews i was sorely disappointed and very offended the author presents a clearly homophobic bias even implying that one becomes homosexual due to abuse this is outdated stereotypical hateful information it seems that if abuse caused homosexuality there would be lots more homosexuals i was hoping for healing and instead found a blame the victim mentality the author clearly presents christianity as the only way through this issue if that appeals to you great if not do not waste your time this book should come with a warning label that clearly states its christian religious message if anything i have written disturbs you don t buy this book there are other very good books available on this topic the product feature says patent shouldn t that mean patent leather but actually they are not leather at all i ordered the red one they look stiff and the color makes me uncomfortable too honestly they are pretty comfortable shoes but make your feet look longer i guess that s because of the style anyway i am sending them back this is a good case protection wise the problem i had with it was the fact that it is really bulky it adds at least cm to the thickness of the phone the headphone jack is covered by a pointless flap that is nothing more than a nuisance when you actually want to plug headphones in it doesn t fit back in place when you want to cover the jack either i ended up cutting it off myself the nd day i had the case even without this pointless flap the hole for the headphone jack is too small for any reasonable auxillary cable to fit in every time i was in the car and wanted to plug my phone into the stereo i would have to take the left side of the case off just to plug in the aux cable with all of these problems i ended up just shelving this ridiculous case and carrying my bold around without any protection down the drain you will never receive the deluxe version of this garlic press through amazon amazon forwards your order to target and they send you the susi ii which does not include the handy cleaning tool which is why i chose this garlic press to begin with when i tried to exchange the susi ii for the susi deluxe all amazon would offer was my money back so some time after making the initial order i have no garlic press at all back to the chopping board a huge disappointment as far as amazon is considered this screams false advertisement it has never taken me months to read a book before i never thought i would ever get through this book but i was determined to finish i liked italy and parts of indonesia i think anyone can write a book on their life everyone has fallen on hard times we just do not write books about it maybe we should i didn t feel sorry for her at all i found her annoying and self absorbed she ran away for a year because she couldn t bare to face her life that she made a mess of i am glad i finished it but i am not glad i read it my setup should have been super simple it was super simple for my old airport extreme mac g desktop without an internal airport card and an airport express my simple goal was to send itunes to my stereo via an airport express after five hours of trying to get it working myself i called applecare after an hour on the phone with applecare we finally got my extreme to link up with my express we had to do three hard resets on my express we had to temporarily hardwire the express to the extreme with an ethernet cable moreover we had to manually copy and paste the airport id number from one unit to the other this procedure was not in the owner s manual or in apple s online self help i have been using macs at home for years and this is the biggest headache that i have ever experienced in the world of apple macintosh i think that the pc guy on the apple commercials got the last laugh on this one this book was so bad that i sent it back over half of it was appendix on connector pin outs on buses isa pci mca apple output ports serial parallel usb interestingly without pin locations and keyboards including the all important commodore usb infomation was insufficient at best shop elsewhere this is like the th one i have bought for my wife the problem with it is after about months to a year the middle speed dryer switch position burns out i finally took apart the last one to see what exactly is happening the switch position just slowly looses its contact so it will not operate on that setting so then she gets mad throws it out and buys a new one she likes the way it feels heats etc so based on our experience if you want to keep buying them over and over you get the picture conservatives good liberals bad repeat times and you can apparently call it a book there are some intelligently argued conservative viewpoints out there but coulter s is not one of them it s way too short my son outgrew it by the time he was weeks old and he s average length also he rolled to one side in it big waste of money difficult to place the broom inside the holes and take it back hook are good for the hand brush i will not recommend this book may be helpful to some parents but i found it to be very contradicting why do pediatric nuerologists and some pshyciatrists not buy into the theory of sensory integration dysfunction i took my son to occupational therapy and it was the worst thing i ve ever done and the place we took him was supposed to be the very best in the field reading this book made me feel as though it was not ok for my child to have any differences i truly believe it s just an excuse to use children as guinea pigs and give parents a placebo effect of therapy this dvd is slow and unmotivating the women who are in the video look like bimbos though i hate to say that the exercising is slow and doesn t really work you out it is good for self defense only not as a workout i read both patrick madrid s where is that in the bible and why is that in tradition while i have respect for catholics and believe that many of them have true faith in jesus i do not agree with many of the catholic beliefs and doctrines i am a christian but i am interested in what catholics believe because i have many friends who are catholics before reading this book i had in my lifetime read the entire bible the vatican ii documents and studied the catholic canons that was enough to convince me that many of the catholic teachings are not in the bible and even go against the teachings of the bible this book failed to convince me otherwise this book teaches the basics but you never have the experience you need to be successful until you have actually done day trading no book can teach you those hands on skills essentially one large advertisement for the dr hauschka line combined with a poorly written self love motivation i found this book to be rather blah no new information about the product line very mediocre home recipes terrible food recipes and lots of really beautiful pictures that could perhaps be considered inspirational skip the book take a bath and give yourself a face mask instead james rosin s documentary on the birth of baseball in the city of brotherly love this is incorrect baseball was born in philadelphia in with the phillies a s came in i found this single to be boring and plain not as good as it could have been she struck out which is too bad her vocals on the show actually sounded better one of the worst books i have ever read a simplistic plot interspered with enough sex to mask the lack of depth plot complexity or character development leaves the reader thoroughly disappointed however if you enjoy sophomoric soap operas you might like this book which is basically a soap opera in murder mystery book clothing for the serious mystery reader this is not your cup of tea i loved the idea of a conservative comedian so i couldn t wait to see this but i felt he had an undercurrent of anger in everything he did and i found it very unpleasant to watch this is the type of book that i shudder to think of some parts are pretty funny but it just goes to show you how divided our country really is i feel ashamed to be a conservative now i could do the same this is boring for me my baby has shown no interest in it either don t waste your money this review is being written for wan technologies ccna companion guide by allan reid this textbook was the worst one of the four companion guides provided in the cisco academy courses for ccna the text does not adequately cover the topics that are in the ccna icnd exam there is not enough detail on the topics introduced neither does it cover the topics in the cisco online academy course if you use this book you can t answer the question in cisco s own online chapter tests for some reason this book diverges from the online curriculum my classmates and the instructor universally agreed that this book is poor note ccna academy courses version use this book the entire curriculum is rewritten making this book obsolete except for academy use as they may still take the old ccna exams after the announced expiration date in november of this year the version of the ccna course being taught varies by academy during this transition time the pump stopped working two weeks after i bought it now i am having a hard time getting the warranty and replacement done by intex vminnovations was great and amazon was great but i would not recommend and intex product you have to be careful when purchasing this product especially when you need to buy more than one package the product is within month to expiration date i tried to use this item once it was so stiff i could barely get the teeth to go down nver mind trying to wash it it s now been sent to the drawer of shame there are serious flaws with this edition of lonely planet bolivia the map of sucre is unusable as the key and points on the street plan don t match up other travellers have told me that other street plans in the book have similar problems at other times the information is incorrect or badly researched to those thinking of travelling in bolivia i would seriously recommend using another guidebook this book was not what i wanted it is to simple even for me even as a beginner i do not like the way this book was described the movie margaret dvd blu ray combo is unreasonably priced the new is almost and the used it there has to be a mistake somewhere in this otherwise it would be absolutly senseless to buy a dvd at that price no matter how good it is i hope that it is merely a mistake like many people have said this cover fit the ironing board perfectly and clothes iron well on top of it but when you iron it stinks if you are like me you ll be shopping for a new cover after ironing a few times i bought this for my year old girl who had smaller pack of stix the sticks that she had were inches long and inch thick the sticks in the box are inches long and little thicker than inches the size of the box is misleading and the included sticks are disappointment if you wanted the bigger sticks i gave this item low stars because of the misleading packaging i know i should have read the item description the thing is i did read it twice and both times i missed where it says sticks are inches long i am hoping that someone in my situation read the low ratings to get the full information otherwise this is fun toy for hands on creative kids definitely not as good as the shampoo it doesn t leave a greasy feel on my hair and i like that but it doesn t seem to actually condition it much either my hair was so dry it crackled and i had to use a leave in conditioner spray to get the comb through it i noticed some breakage as well unless you have extremely oily hair i d leave this conditioner alone whilst sitting in my world cultures class one day shortly before christmas break our teacher explained that there would be a project due when we returned collective groan the assignment was to watch this movie and write a summary report i was wary at first and soon found that this feeling was justified throughout most of this film the actions of the characters are either overplayed or drawn out and boring what looks like a plot twist at first becomes a staple for the movie happening again and again until it can no longer be classified as a plot twist at risk of sounding uninteligent i d say the best word to describe this film is just silly i used this pitter for making a cherry pie and it worked great then the second time that i used it to pit an olive the base fell off this item is not worth purchasing this product did not fit as described talking to cusinart they said they have not made part like this for long time and it is better to buy new cusinart rather than try this after market product i have had this monitor for over a year now and did love it until recently i usually sleep with it next to me in bed while it charges however when it is plugged in the monitor stays on continuously i must have leaned on it during the night and turned it on and being plugged in it didn t turn off it actually melted completely fried the screen is now black and buttons do not work it actually smoked i would be very cautious if purchasing this product i am a strong supporter for the earlier real wheel videos before dave and becky began to fight during each of their episodes however this one should be skipped for more sensitive children specifically dave and becky fight a little more harshly than in their previous videos and i am not too keen on having my children exposed to monster trucks named big dummy granted they ll probably be exposed to this language later on i d just rather it didn t happen on my watch the text itself is great however i ordered a new copy but received a very obviously used one dog ears on pages corners worn would not qualify as very good let alone new as long as games such as winning eleven or in europe int super star soccer pro evolution exist there is no way for this game to sell the very bad gameplay kills the well made graphics i wouldn t buy it the story isn t bad a little disjointed at times but when you near the end you realize the end is not near i saw no indication on the cover or amazon s info to indicate the story was incomplete i would think there should be some indication that this is one of a series and where in the sequence it lies if you are trying to avoid wheat or gluten this book is not the best choice the recipes appear to be designed using wheat flour with gluten free substitutions listed below each if you have any experience with gluten free baking you know that simply substituting a different kind of flour is often not enough so far the recipes i have tried have not turned out very well and i have had more luck adapting old recipes that are not intended for people with food allergies this book might be helpful if you are just starting out trying to provide foods for a child with food allergies and are having trouble coming up with ideas otherwise your money would be better spent on a book by bette hagman or carol fenster these sprinklers are the least expensive they are also cheap you will be replacing them before one season is over i bought had to be replaced immediately they stop rotating and there is nothing you can do lube with the water makes it stickier this product is total junk spend more per sprinkler and get some piece of mind and save your back from having to dig them up twice i love myrtle beach and all of the south and was very excited to read a southern author what a huge disappointment i m curious how this is a national bestseller as advertised i loved the case when i first got it it fit well seemed to protect it very well then i took my zen out of the case and it was scatched terribly the case just rubs dirt that gets in there against your player and messes it up get a hard case instead this thing is worthless looks good but calendar function is broke runs both fast and slow how can a company that wants to stay in business make such crap this was not what i was looking for i keep my head shaved not skin so i thought this should work great i use it without the guards to get that close shave and it feels like it s scraping my head the other thing i don t like about it is that i have hold down the power button when shaving my head kind of sucks when your trying to shave the back of your head and hold the power button on at the same time so all in all no i would not recommend this product to friends and family i can see why it was discontinued i have to say they are thinner see thru and the waistband is like hemming tape odd reminds me why i don t usually buy clothing without seeing in person merchant was fine though i am sure it is a good cd that is the reason why i ordered it however i never received the merchandise from the vendor simply put there was just not enough relevant material to warrant a book in order to fill out his original magazine article to book length krakauer takes bird walk after circuitous bird walk with mind numbing redundancy how often does one need to emphasize it was his last fill in the blank beyond the first and final few chapters the rest is irrelevant fluff that verges on deification of a pretty standard disillusioned youth searching to find himself the story is interesting in a way that a car accident on the side of the road is little more but krakauer treats the subject with such reverence that you would think him a latter day saint save time and read the outside magazine article this perfume smells wonderful what is a total bummer especially since it is made by dior is that the perfume fades in a few hours you need to reapply it it does not last i can buy perfume that lasts all day it must have a lot of alcohol in it and that is a rip off this cd contains rolling stones songs sung by very bad performers don t be fooled this is not by the rolling stones these do not hold up well after just a few days of light use they are cracking at the seams too bad because it s such a great design this book describes the guilt and pain of amanda and how those emotions affected her entire family and even those within her community although the book starts well i almost quit reading half way through it the plot lines move slowly and there are sudden jumps in time you ll be reading along in one chapter you run across a break and the next thing you know several years have passed however you don t even know that for several paragraphs so it s too easy to get distracted and confused i also think too many sub plots and the recollections of the characters were not always expanded upon enough either i did think that amanda mathilda and ruth are well developed characters and you do feel sympathy for them all however i would have liked to see ruth s father carl and imogene ruth s friend and something else to the story more developed imogene especially i felt like i didn t really know here the descriotion said it had george wendt in it and he s nowhere to be found also the director listed was different i already ahd this video and thought i was getting a different and hopefully better version of the story i felt ripped off hi guys i was given a stand mixer for xmas and love it to death it is an item in my kitchen that i wonder how i did without it so when trying to expand my collection i purchased the ice cream maker attachment and took delivery of it last week only to find that it does not fit australian purchased mixers not happy kitchenaid buyer beware annoyed a bitthanksbrettd these shirts were left out in the diret sunlight for an extended period of time they re all faded out they are a darker in color under where the stick on size tag was attached the tag happenes to be stuck on the chest area so it s very noticable save your money and buy from a reputable store this book had a lot of already known information it did have a few good tips but overall not worth buying the whole book maybe it would be helpful for others i have purchased these crackers numerous times and they are always good we eat a lot of them so i buy in large quantities the problem this time was that i purchased box of wasabi crackers and several boxes of cheese crackers on nov th the sell by date on the wasabi was june of but the cheese date was feb of had i known this i would not have bought as many of the cheese i do not see that there is any way for me to know the sell date is there on every other occasion the sell by date has been reasonable and we have been pleased cognitive dissonance boy i wish i d waited for the paperback and then waited some more for it to show up in the used book stores and then burned the damn thing without reading it trade it for an ol yeller dog and shoot the dog i read the first sentence in each paragraph and skim fast i wished i d never gotten the first book because my insatiable human curiosity now drives me to see if jordan ever recovers his initial promise i purchased this as a gift well in advance of when i gave it imagine my surprise when we finally got around to viewing it to discover that of a five disc set we had two disc and no disc neither amazon nor mars would make good on it because of the extra month or so til we discovered the mistake anyone need an extra disc third season i found this book to be much less than offered no new insights if you know even a little bit about health you will regret wasting your money mercola is good but use judgement about his recommendations what a disappointment i just threw it in the trash it is essentially a home video put on dvd poor quality both in terms of the setting filming etc as well as the dance which can be very fun and beautiful and good funky style instead this was the poor definition of funky truthfully if this was offered to me free i would turn it down i meant to give it zero stars but the system seems to require at least one star to submit the review this is a shame because i saw the instructor on tv recently and she was much better and more well presented the movie is quite good showing that given the right material elvis presley could have been an outstanding actor this was a step in the right direction but too late in his acting career i was hoping this dvd issue would show this movie off in great light unfortunately this was not the case the company have used an inferior copy and dvd just enhance any problems with the print i hope in the future we will get a first generation copy for our collections the rating given refers to the quality of the dvd and not the actual movie which should be stars i got this for my birthday and loved it made great coffee until the plunger broke after month the plastic plunger is made of really light weight plastic a few cents worth of plastic to beef the plunger up would have made this star into a star as it stands now it s a bad design i ll probably go with another brand in case the other bonjour presses have the same problem or at least look at the plungers very carefully i purchased this pencil sharpener july of ready to start the school year it lasted the whole months i unpacked it for the next school year and only made it half way through my students only sharpen pencils a day if needed so it is only operated for min each morning i expected it to last longer being it was a heavy duty sharpener these are nice tumblers a bit difficult to keep looking clean not sure why i had been using them for months and then one day i took one from the cabinet and added some ice then pop the ice shattered the inside glass while i was holding it i understand the idea of thermal shock but the glass was not even hot or warm this should not have happened i will probably get some more since they keep drinks cold but i don t think i will be buying these again update well i bought another set and lost another glass this time in the dishwasher gotta think they could design these a bit better so they don t just splode at the slightest disturbance in temperature they do keep stuff cold though just be careful and then expect them to blow up even then like everyone else is saying this is absolute garbage and the company is trying to scam you by posting bogus star reviews on amazon all products by transparent language are basically a page piece of text spoken aloud by a native speaker to lay the foundations of your language learning they use short useless help files a one page list of the letters of the alphabet and a very sparse introduction to the different parts of speech and nothing else what they re selling individually for was originally all bundled together for on the languages of the world cd but as you can imagine they re making quite the killing doing things this way there are a few reviewers who seem to actually believe the product deserves stars but i seriously doubt they ve ever used any other language software in their life i m convinced you d learn more spanish from dora the explorer s happytime funland well i had heard such great things about this movie from critics but it was abominably bad i thought that the movie would go from comedian to comedian all showcasing their formidable talents at the aristocrats joke nope instead a hour borefest only highlighted by sarah silverman gilbert gottfried and the south park kids almost at the end of the movie comedians are still yakking about why the aristocrats is so great what makes it great the structure etc mind numbingly boring and totally unfunny an uncoordinated mess with most of the hours actually filled with z level talents you ve never heard of talking about the mechanics of the joke rather than trying to make anyone laugh two days after seeing it my girlfriend is still angry i made her come along with me to see it it s that bad avoid this movie gives a vague description of what the mind can do and how it works following a story lines based on military tactics sexual attractions and why some people like to kill and have no remorse their are some good theories but how they translate the information is for the unintelligent sorry i give this film two thumbs down it seems to me that the history channel dumbs down a lot of their documentaries for the dumb people who write in and complain how they can t grasp the information unless you have an it background i found this way too complicated to set up and returned it to amazon it was the first time i ever did anything like that if you need the kodak klic for your camera do yourself a favor and just order the kodak battery very disappointed batter was too large for my kodak z is camera had to bang the camera to get the batter out don t buy this one well for me it s a bad experience with this item in my case it woks fine only months after that this have an erratic perfomance at this mommnet i take a decisition dont use it anymore i like bill murray but this movie was aweful charlotte is a pretentious little snot and you can just see coppola living vicariously through her this is basically a movie about a self absorbed little girl who has the hots for an over the hill but presumably very rich actor murray plays the sleasball well the only thing worth watching in this movie the plot what there is of it is weak poor charlotte has to suffer lonliness in her star hotel room for a week while her hobby go plays photographer they re in the bar their in their rooms they re in a nightclub blah no story no imagination pretentious insufferable adolescent basically what you d expect from a pampered little b ch like sofia coppola i learnt a hard lesson here you get what you pay for i needed to replace a vga cable that had ferrite cores to eliminate interference these cables failed badly i m using a x monitor with a dell pc after switching to these cables the computer couldn t even recognize the monitor it was using a couple of minutes ago the image was ghosting and blurry obviously the signal is so degraded with these cables that the video card couldn t detect the monitor and even with tweaking the image was still blurry and ghosting the final straw was that the screws didn t line up with the slots so it was difficult to connect the cable securely i found most of the patterns offered to be blatant retreads of early s fare the granny squares and heavy yarns look cheap and dated to me not cute the eyelash yarn bolero and fur trimmed coat are worthy inclusions but not worth the price of the book also i was quite surprised at the lack of finishing information correct seaming and finishing can make the difference between a beautiful handmade heirloom garment and a tacky homemade item surely some time spent explaining the best techniques would be worthwhile peter huber was on c span last sunday he lets us know that oil will not last since oil can be produced from canadian sands for it should be amusing to follow this prediction is he unaware of net energy questions and eroei he was followed by three hours of dr helen caldicott which believe it or not was easier to take i bought a couple of these sd s after building a gig storage server in the basement and moving to gig xpcs on the desktop all was working well with excellent throughput and a nice quiet desktop then data transfer started to slow down by a process of elimination i worked out the switch was dropping packets all over the place i replaced the faulty switch with another sd months later my network performance has fallen through the floor again it didn t take long to work out that i m losing about of my packets between the router and the pc i won t be buying another sd very good quality i was thinking about getting a sleep number bed until i saw the price tag then i thought why don t i try a portable air mattress i am now sleeping better and can adjust the air pressure to suite my needs each night if needed ment to update this review right away but forgot this air mattress started leaking within a week of getting it it leaked so bad that it was completely flat by morning i sent it back and went to wal mart and bought a memory foam mattress enhancer not quite the bargain this was the memory foam mattress has given me a very comfortable bed and i am still enjoying it months later stay away from these air mattresses only aunque tu mami no quiera by sierra meastra was something exciting by an artist i did not already know i just compared the tracks by eliades ochoa and pio leyva with similar tracks on cds by these artists and the ones on this cd are less good they have less punch they are sort of grey i have been a follower of jackson browne s music for years and have never been so disappointed in his work self conscious hectoring tripe none of the vitality of lawyer s in love nor the depth of image and feeling of the everyman period as someone who plays all of my music from digital libraries the copy protection was also annoying if i pay for a copy i expect my fair use rights to be respected until electra asylum reverses their policy on copy protection and issues refunds or replacement copies of these crippled goods to affected users their label is off of my buy list for anyone who thinks that laura is a christian woman who should be taken seriously please remember laura ingraham is to christianity as saddam hussein is to they re both attached to extreme radical groups on the periphery but have no direct connection this book is unfocused and rambling the premise is snide hateful and anti intellectual read a library copy like i did don t waste your money garmin n vi inch portable gps navigator with us canada european mapstook the nuvi to small towns in italy in the mountains it frequently couldn t find the satellite for a long while then when we either went around mountains or drove in streets in the old villages it would give directions and then say recalculating and make a u turn and then send us another direction or back to the original direction in taking the autostrada to amalfi it took us off of the main road that we were on and put us on a parallel road that took longer and made no sense to change addresses were hard to program in we couldn t find a way to just program the gps to take us to a city center did find that larger cities seemed to do better but didn t really trust it after all of the mistakes the cover page of this book says healthy cooking without wheat gluten dairy eggs yeast or refined sugar but it doesn t really deliver on that promise if you have intolernaces to multiple ingredients your options in this book are going to be extremely limited and it should be titled baking breads and desserts not cooking my expectation was to find some recipes for entrees i could prepare as well as desserts there weren t any overall this book is not worth it i ll sell you mine used new condition the product was advertised for a cup coffee maker it is only a cup too small for cup maker had to take the filter out of the unit and use the old filter holder i did not receive what i thought was discribed i would advise do not purchase this product if you have a cup coffee maker someone should have banned this cd it is the worst cd i have heard a mix of rap and slut in a tight leather outfit britney has outdone the definition of bad the songs are a mixture of different styles and her voice does justice to none of them the words are trite and lack any form of worthiness i have a very extensive collection of cd s but this one will not be one and i have serious doubts that any future attempts by her will be added most famous artist enter a slut phase but the really good ones get back out of it let us hope britney wakes up and manages to realize she has a decent voice before she ends up singing in third rate bars with a cover charge and a pole this is easily the worst printer i ve ever owned i tried to use it on my macintosh network through the airport connected by usb i tried to connect it directly to one of my computers through usb it didn t make a difference on the setup which basically only does about half of what s advertised even after downloading the latest drivers the scanner was nearly useless my year old flatbed did a better job and had more features the ink cartridges last for pages i m on my th or th one in months and tired of the office max people knowing me by name i got this for free as part of an apple promotion and still feel like i got ripped off this movie is a favorite of mine i lost my previous copy and decided to order another from here when i received the dvd from this company i come to discover the terrible quality of it it is as if it is a pirated copy terrible video quality along with poor audio i feel terrible for those who witness such a great film for the first time on such disappointing quality look somewhere else for this product i have returned my copy and expect a refund myself works as advertised for a while however after a little use and getting some sweat on them these are sports headphones right the volume buttons failed to work worse the down button repeated itself dropping the volume to minimum and the up button wouldn t respond so the headphones became uselessly stuck at very low volume so i sent this first pair in to motorola for an exchange they responded admirably with a new pair amazingly after a few more weeks of use this new pair did the exact same thing a bummer because i like the features and convenience the only other negative is that for phone conversations the sound only comes in one ear not both this was a bad impulse purchase i scanned it to make sure the pictures weren t scary but i didn t read it from cover to cover as endearing as some may find these characters to be this story annoys me reading all the woof s gets old after the first sitting and the story is just too sappy for me in addition i don t like halloween books that show children trick or treating alone i know this is nitpicking but i don t want my child getting the idea that wandering the streets alone at night is a safe thing to do on the plus side this is a lift the flap book and little ones enjoy the hide and seek qualities these kinds of books offer there are so many wonderful halloween books today this isn t one of them this pump is not good i got queasy everytime i looked down at the horn it s hard to clean too and did i mention it s painful a friend of mine gave me her medela breast pump machine i can t see pumping any other way if you call medela they will tell you that you should only use the pump on one person for sanitary reasons but you can buy new horns bottles membranes tubes etc at minimal cost directly from medela or sometimes your local drug store the breast milk never reaches the inside pumping mechanism it goes into the horn and drips directly into the bottle no one should have to pump manually the lid does not close tightly so use a sealed baggie if you use it for liquids or dressings like i did so it doesn t spill everywhere i played nfl k before but i gave madden a chance with the rosters madden has more features like old school teams practice drills card trades etc but if you just want to play with your buddies on or offline nothing beats the tackles and hustles of sega nfl k series the tackling is hard in madden there s no slamming or effect on the tackle it s plain i still can t figure out the audible in sega nfl k you just press a button to call an audible and a list of optional plays will be displayed for you to choose in madden nothing appears i guess you are expected to know the sequence of play from the controller buttons this is the last time i m buying madden i bought these because i had tried several other headphones one costing and could not find a pair that offered good sound and was comfortable these were inexpensive and the reviews were decent so i figured what did i have to lose by trying them the answer to that question is shipping to and from amazon i cannot recommend them even for the pet shop boys tweak their sound a bit here bringing in an orchestra for a few songs and giving the guitars more prominence but they don t seem to have had much fun doing it the end result is an album that s far more impressive than involving with the exception of being boring a beautifully understated pop song the boys always sound as if they re holding something back even how can you expect to be taken seriously sounds timid despite the introduction of power chords superior versions of being boring and jealousy can be found on discography so start there it dawned on me is the only real song on the entire cd worthy of any attention it s a solid rock song trendy yet it s the kind of song that can get any band some attention however i wonder about the talents of this group when i listen to the rest of the cd made me seriously doubt their song writing abilities the rest of the cd sound like a bunch of below standard b sides thrown together just to make up a whole cd the rest of the songs from through sound so much alike that i can t really distinguish one from the other they re all monotoned and boring songs that have none of the rock feel of the first i was seriously disappointed i won t give any stars for this but i since i have to i m giving it since i can t believe that the band members would honestly think this is their best effort for a whole new cd kristen bell is a workaholic who has not had time to find a man to settle down with yet she desires companionship while attending the wedding of her sister in italy she inadvertently casts a spell over several men who are now in love with her despite a strong cast this film lacks elements of charm humor and romance all of which are absent in this weak effort true blood spends too much time in nudity and the obscene and not enough time developing a story the death scences of a vampires are gross when they turn into a mess of blood the characters are hard to believe and act like idots most of the time the love sookie stackhouse is supposed to feel for bill the vampire is lacking you don t feel the magic between them their facial expressions don t even show a deeping love the secondary characters are a drag on the show i e sheriff etc very poor activng or directing whichever emotion is entirely missing in the acting for the entire cast it is definitely not one that i would considering purchasing or rewatching beyond the hbo initial series give it one star after seeing moonlight true blood is a belly flop at least hbo didn t dump the audience that enjoys this show like cbs did moonlight or lifetime did blood ties tour is very good tour was received without an activation code vendor never responded to my request for the code and amazon refunded my purchase price you mailed to me xenit mold cleaner so i still don t have the xenit citrus cleaner and remover oz product i can t rate it i never got it but if i have to rate so you can get this message i will to preface i think liss is a great author and i really loved his first novel a conspiracy of paper a novel ballantine reader s circle was fantastic and completely riveting i picked up this book in a discount bin and i understand why it was there the story isn t entirely uninteresting but he frequently substitutes a rant for a story liss seemed more interested in telling me what he wanted me to think rather than telling me a story it made the characters completely one dimensional ultimately if you want to read a mishmash of a novel and animal rights propaganda get this book if you want a great story with fantastic writing and interesting characters try one of his other books the preview give you all the cool action sequences so there isnt a lot of surprises norton and wahlberg seems emotionless with their action the more comedic scenes are with seth green the best part has to be the soundtrack and the use of pink floyd i like david spade and i thought joe dirt was his best movie this one is terrible i don t think i laughed once spade plays a washed up actor who decides to pay a family to give him the childhood he never head so he will have the experience to play a roll in a rob reiner film spade cracks lame jokes throughout and ends up with the family s mother the father was a creep and spade behaved himself throughout so no need to shelter the kiddies the only good thing about this film was the appearance of former child stars like leif garrett danny boniducci and barry williams if they had had larger parts the movie might have been funnier at the end during the credits a large group of child stars assemble to sing a we are the world type song the only reason i gave this pos a star don t waste your time see joe dirt instead this was not to my liking not my type of film or humor i watched about thirty minutes of it or less i found it inane and a waste of my time i thought this movie was terrible low budget is no excuse for a poor script and acting i can t believe they got rutger hauer to be in this turkey must have spent the whole budget on his salary this is the kind of thing one writes in their first creative writing class and properly never shows anyone ever again unimaginative unoriginal sloppily constructed and it ends poorly anyone who has read phillip k dick and if you haven t buy something by him instead will be amazed at the shallow work here i give it an extra star for the woodcuts which are attractive and clever it s well built trimmer works great easy to clean just pop off the head and rinse under a tap the shave is very comfortable it is loud but no louder than the average foil razor for shaving the sides of your face it does a great job provided the hairs aren t too long however as with all foil razors that i ve used it does an unacceptable job on the neck area and below the jaw the foil design is the limiting factor here and this is why rotary razors are vastly superior to foils overall rotaries can be irritating to some so they are not for everybody its time companies like braun too overhaul the whole foil design concept and come up with a new design my recommendation try a rotary razor first if you can t take the irritation then this one is probably your best bet just be prepared for the horrible shave it gives anywhere below the jaw this book started out as really interesting but i really didn t like that the main character was raped or any of the other events that went along with it book was good but i m going to go straight to book i watched this for the first time last night and after watching totoro spirited away secret life of arrieti this movie falls short the characters are not believable or in any way likable if you are looking for more great movie magic from ghibli studio skip this at the risk of oversimplifying this was kinda like a gay version of bonnie and clyde burnt money is about a gay couple involved in a botched bank robbery in argentina in they escaped to uruguay where their relationship unraveled and where the police caught up with them one main problem about this movie was that it dragged on endlessly one has some kind of mental issue going on the other is somewhat of a sex addict or rather he seeks thrills despite the fact he s supposed to be in hiding and with the traditional machismo thing going on among latino men these two men just cannot be comfortable with each other when things come to an end that is when the police trapped them they reconnect and renew their love for each other overall a disappointing film i received it today it turned on twice won t turn on again amazon is shipping a replacement today but i m seriously considering just cancelling that and ordering a high powered fm transmitter and a half dozen boomboxes and being done when i put this in it looked great for the first week but as the ring started to tarnish it caused an infection i clean my piercing frequently and have worn other surgical steel rings but had no problems definitely don t waste your money we have had several of these over the years lightening or any erratic electricity seems to take them out pretty easily also when you buy a replacement it may or may not work sometimes we have to buy three or four to get one that works for a while we keep trying because we need the sound alert in the house that someone or something is coming this dvd was trash it would not play on any dvd player it was bogus dvd goonies i was ripped off and when i tried to follow up with amazon i got no help will never use amazon again i returned the ebook version of this book the mudras are referenced by number but somehow the numbers are lost in the ebook version there are chapters on recharging energy reserves solving everyday problems etc but the recommended mudras are referenced by number since the numbers are not there i couldn t find the mudras i was interested in the prints on this dvd are for the most part the same old crappy prints we ve been seeing for years on television home video even though hallmark owns beautifully restored prints of most of laurel and hardy s best talkies guess they thought nobody would notice teach these bozos a lesson buy the german dvds a friend recommended this book to me so respecting her opinion i read it what a waste of time it s written in passive voice totally boring and filled with cliched characters who have mixed message motivations ms steele drops plot lines like the proverbial hot potato and her foreshadowing is poor though maybe she doesn t need it there s hardly an event you can t see coming after reading this and jewels i ll give anyone a second chance i have to wonder why ms steele is still being published there are too many good books and too little time to waste said time on ms steele spare yourself the anguish and read something else instead oh yes there was one good thing about it victor garber did the narration and that s the only thing that kept me going til the end he could make a telephone listing sound interesting mark fuhrman who has no expertise as a medical investigator nor any first hand knowledge of the terri schiavo case has written a work of fiction that contradicts the reality of the tragic situation exploited by the radical right wing nut cases in this nation it is amazing that the wm morrow corporation would even publish such a revisionist history that is not supported by the facts such as the official autopsy the first clue that the book is fiction comes with the admission that sean hannity asked the author to write this piece of trash sean hannity himself throughout the whole sordid tragedy of the terri schiavo case nightly showed no respect for the facts when he stated his opinions on the theatrics which were an assault on common sense and decency anyone who wastes their money in purchasing this fictional account is obviously a fool this is a well manufactured mouse but if you use the middle button a lot forget it it s much stiffer than the middle button on logitech s other mice and may give you a bruise if you try to use it too much also the acceleration was very different from most mice it can undoubtedly be adjusted in software preferences but i fail to see the justification for a mouse that doesn t work out of the box these days after trying this mouse for a couple of hours i returned it and got myself a trusty mx no surprises there just a good mouse i ve always disliked corman for his views as well as haig and now add hill however this movie has pam grier in it making it for me worth watching although i prefer women in cages minus the sadism this one while shouting out viva la revolucion which makes my blood boil i hate revolutions actually makes fun of revolutions in sid haig s character and the plot and he plays mimicks the guard s sexuality but i can t stand guerillachic despite it s funny moments the movie is too drawn out and boring and the women with the exception of the local women and pam are ugly that tall blonde looks like a man and that curly haired one looks butchy as well sadly netflix showed it and i watched it but it s one of the worst of the genre i have seen at least the revolution never came and it never will thankgod this is the lamest flash gordon ever i am a huge flash gordon fan but this series is less than a joke before purchasing tony hawk skateboard be aware that it requires a battery pak to operate it of course the battery pak is not included with the purchase this is obviously a marketing strategy to make it appear that you re not paying more money for a toy the other frustrating thing about this is that i my son have had his tony hawk since late november and i have not been unable to find a battery pak to buy the store where i made the purchase never has the battery in stock your only alternative is to buy it online and pay additional money for shipping when i first saw this piece on amazon com i seriously gasped it is sooooooooo cute and since it is from paris my idol i knew i must have it sadly though when reading other s review some complain of the crystals falling out the satin cord falling apart and the piece being extremely smaller than expected i mean i want a nice piece of jewerly i want it a bit big for others to notice it i want the cord to hold up for a long time and i really want the stones to stay in place i mean for of my own money its got to be nice i got for my blind father one didnt have battery as it should and the other sounded terrible cant understand and said the wrong time mismatching time displayed i will return them buy another brand from another source the movie s awesome but the horrible sound quality makes it hard to sit through you can t hear any of the dialogue unless you turn up the volume real high but then all the sound effects become deafening buy it because it s a classic but know you will be disappointed really this movie has nothing to redeem it s value do not purchase this unless you ve seen every other movie made and really need another movie to watch one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and wish i hadn t paid for it a potboiler whose pace quickens and thickens only because its story stretches taut over a mindfield of plot contrivances and utterly incredible coincidences a white nuckle light read yes memorable mystery no i have read every tom clancy book since the beginning everyone knows his strengths and weaknesses so there aren t many surprises i do expect to be entertained by his books but i wasn t this time i simply can t stomach the endless racist remarks executive orders got by with only a few references to ragheads to refer to people of the islamic faith here however there are constant and ongoing racist and cultural slurs against chinese people i won t dignify them by repeating them also jack ryan has become incredibly tiresome he has turned into a self righteous ultra right wing character who loathes anyone who disagrees with him and spends all his time whining about how he doesn t want to be president it s time for clancy to move on from this series and get back to writing entertaining thrillers with interesting characters expected quality of webkinz i ve purchased in past but this was smaller than expected and much less well made pink fur was sparse and uneven not cute or cuddly very disappointed makes me regret purchasing items on line the absolute worst piece of crap i ve ever been subjected to there ought to be laws covering crimes such as this bought it returned it it s not safe ours had two pieces of plastic that were never adheared properly and it was obvious the rest of the plastic that was adheared was not done so very well it would have never sustained an accident instead we were more then happy to fork out the extra money for the britax decathlon i suggest you do the same there is no price tag on the life of our children i was given these as a christmas gift two years ago the lids don t fit unless i m steaming a roasted pepper a bowl is a bowl but they are flat bottomed with a groove that can make it hard to properly mix stuff they do have measurements on the inside however that are helpful am i confused here did i just give dj shadow star i sure did i am not a i like your old stuff better than your new stuff zealot but i have my limits this is just terrible piss weak crunk trash i really dont have anything else to say about this other than thank god that i can still turn to diplo and rjd to help me forget i heard this please dj shadow come back to us and ditch this daarrrty soouuth crap this book contains wrong information of the great kevin mitnick i heard that there is a movie coming out if you wish to read a good and true book about him read the fugitive game all in all they have decent sound at best their lyrics suck and their lead singer is just as bad some of the songs are decent good times and remember when but after that its all downhill they have very little talent if you want a decent punk cd buy something from mxpx or ace troubleshooter maybe you ll like it but make sure you listen to some songs before you ever buy this cd p s whoever compared them to mxpx is an idiot i was and man this albumn is boring it s a watered down version of brit pop mixed with harmonic and samples it sounds fun when you read about it but it s boring and tedious to listen to do youself a favor and pick up some old bowie instead i did not like these curlers at all they did not heat up enough and they just did not work the only reason i did not send them back is because i destroyed the package will never do that again very disappointed the battery that was shipped to me was apparently used and will not hold a sufficient charge it ended up being worse than the old battery that i already had in the phone find another vendor that will sell you a new battery don t waste your time and money here i was delighted to find the lattimore translation available for kindle until i bought it who needs a sample clearly this is the lattimore and discovered it is in fact the alexander pope translation which i most certainly do not want sigh i would have loved the lattimore translation for kindle i absolutlly love johanna lindsey i don t think there has been a book that i haven t liked well except for this one to put it nicely it was weak there was no plot most of the book focused around the lincoln s the main character s emotional drama in reality im not even sure you could even call it a romance it s more like a i m a whiny boy that can t grow out of my childhood waaaa woe is me you get my point if you don t believe me than at least wait for the less expensive paperback so when you re done reading it you wont feel like you ve wasted that much money it s realy not worth your time i bought this book hoping for some good ideas and a little inspiration instead i got book full of so called murals and tompe l oeil that the average person would never use some of the projects in this book are so rudimentary and plain ugly including a q bertesque wall that i am embaressed to say i own this book yeesh the mother in law was overbearing no doubt about that however i rarely found myself empathizing with ellie at all she overreacted to everything her mother did ellie was just so childish i wanted to slap her the most interesting aspect to the story was ellie s relationship with her father i wish the author had spent more time on that cause the oh my mother in law is so terrible thing got old very quickly i adore jane green s other books but not this one not nearly as funny as i was led to believe however i will sit through pretty much anything with jemaine clement this book is for lazy parents children need to be loved nottaught to think that their needs are of no concern does researchindicate that any babies have been mentally or physically injured with use of this book left to lay in their cribs and die didn t the couple from texas whose wife killed the five children use this book careful young vulnerable parents check out the research if you want the best for your baby this was the easiest choice for worst film of the year in history where to begin there is no plot no script just three incredibly annoying morons running around in the woods screaming implausibilities abound after researching the size of these woods it is obvious that walking in a straight line would lead to streets or highways in a short time and what kind of moron would go into the house at the end unarmed and then continue filming at a time when his or her life was in immediate danger totally unbelievable and boring ok i played metal gear years ago when it first came out on nintendo i played a few times with newer games but i have not been a big game player since my early teen years now at i thought this system looked great so i bought it and metal gear at the same time since i thought it would be like the older ones from years ago boy was i wrong i like a game you can just start and go but this is not that kind of game this has a card system that you have to use to move and do everything with too confusing for an old school gamer like me i had one of these it worked for about two years and then died i lost all of my data after searching the internet i found that there are known issues with this model and others experienced the same problems i did i called maxtor tech help they said nothing could be done and they recommended i buy a new one i would not recommend this product this remake of a classic film is an abomination supposedly thethrust of the changes was to remove racist elements i have watched the original many times and i don t see any racist elements unless you consider the depiction of africans kicking the out of the british army to be racist in the remake a mysterious black bodybuilder guides harry faversham step by step through his odyssey the ralph richardson character is reduced to a screaming idiot please watch the original and throw this one in the roundfile another trashy song from a talentless prostitute made simply for shock value but only to come up as stupid degrading to society enough said now excuse me while i get back to listening to my class act oleta adams this game sucks the gameplay is horrilble it would have been a hit in the graphics are horrible in fact they shouldn t even call these graphics don t buy ever buy this game unless your desperate and you need something to feed the fire with i purchased one of these units only to find that it was missing parts i had a heat reflector from a model i bought years ago so that wasnt the problem when i turned this unit on to cook a chicken i heard a bunch of crackling noises and when i looked at the oven door it was shattering into hundreds of pieces the glass starting falling everywhere needless to say roasted chicken might of been a great dinner but i had to settle for a cup of soup now i cant even get ronco to respond about their so called warranty is this breakage or defect who knows but still noone responds to my need to replace this glass door help anybody we loved iron man we thought iron man had a weak story line with so so characters although the black widow is introduced as a character in this movie there is nothing to tell you who she is or what her history is the story did not set up the villin m rouke although he plays a good bad guy in other movies you did not know his story other than a few second of something about father vs father very disappointing we thought it was worth two stars for the iron man costume alone i have read many reviews from online websites who have done early reviews for this set it turns out that warner bros furnished fox with the old late s dvd of blazing saddles it isn t the new one that is the th anniversary edition i have heard other complain about transfers being non anamorphic and in this day and age what a huge waste of time resources and energy this was thrown together so poorly fox should have the sets pulled until they can do it right they should also throw the crappy wb discs of blazing saddles back to them and say thanks but no thanks jackdvd aol com this magazine is a fantastic collection of information about new products and places to go it advertises in the form of articles like most magazines today it covers products related to the hobby so if you want to know more about sleeping bags hiking sticks hiking trails etc this is the magazine for you the pictures are handy for a kid to cut out when doing one of those lame homework assignments got it for dollars and i see it is dollars again wait for that deal don t spend more than that it isn t worth it for a good magazine about stratagy go for boys life it is an all around good magazine for kids and adults the fine metal mesh that sits on top of the moving blades got immediately caught in between broke and start cutting skin like hell ordered another mesh for warranty did not cover it then same problem again mesh moves when it should not gets caught in the blades brakes and then it is your skin not hair gets cut ouch terrible painful literally a bloody product if you re into serious masochism this is the product that will make your day otherwise buy something else although i will admit to haveing read all of the series i am hooked on the concept i now feel the authors are are dancing on the edge of breaking the commandment thou shalt not steal this would have been a great or volume series the good news is that i have found that it is possible to read the entire book in about hours find a comfy chair try it next rainy day ok read author s viewpoint penatrated the facts of a good story who is against helping the homeless i would have enjoyed it more if the people being interviewed were the story not the writer the interesting people living in those tunnels are the story but jennifer toth has struck gold with her other reviews they are all over google shows you what the media knows great product don t buy it here i had refused to believe the reports of other reviewers but they are true despite the item description promising tubes note plural amazon continues to ship a single individual tube of chapstick to numerous customers myself and the several reviewers here included what a dissapointment it was slow to start but i thought it would pick up i painfully finished but felt that there were several lose ends relationship with her husband after all her turmoil i gave it one star because it cured me of insomnia i ve owned three seal a meal vacuum sealers and all failed working correctly one in as little as a two weeks customer service was excellent and quickly sent me a replacment for each unit but they kept breaking down either the seal is inadequate or the vacuum doesn t finish before it starts to seal i junked the last unit and just bought a foodsaver so far my impressions of the foodsaver are much more favorable lighter wider seal and easier to line up the bags for sealing my title is the scary search my author is iris johansen the important character is maggie the genre of this book is mystery it s about maggie and her dog searching for a little girl and it takes two days to find this girl the little girl was playing at school and somebody snatched her from her school she s thirteen years old and has two sisters and two brothers maggie said the guy that took her i think he wants to deal with the police for money the guy said i want to make a trade for one million dollars tomorrow at six o clock at her school i really don t like the book because it s really boring and i m not interested in it there s two hundered and ninety eight pages in this book it s very easy that s why i didn t like the book i do not recommend it because i don t like the book the search was a horrible book iriver x ext usb dualformat dbl layer dvd rw idvd ddbe i bought this used and i didn t even get what the desription says it is i got an i o magic external dvd player don t ever do that unless it s coming directly from amazon the people i bought it from did not send everything i needed either to install the dvd properly i asked for the driver cd and got a response saying they didn t have it it s useless to me now because there are no drivers available online for it do not buy from from naomi and howard i am very disappointed with these sheets i have never had thread count sheets wear so badly i have a front load washer which is more gentle with laundry than a top loader and still nubs they are about to hit the trash and i have had them just over a month d this is insignificant music pj s worst ever effort thatdoesn t get much better upon further playing light years thin air of the girl and sleight of hand are just ok breakherfall god s dice and evacuation are all knock off s of hail hail and poor knock off s at best the only good song on this disc is nothing as it seems and you can save your money by buying the single and skipping this horrid excuse for artistic expression i never thought i d say this but i d rather listen to britney spears than this my disc will be used as a coaster or frisbee i guess pj missed again the corrs embody all that is wrong with music in the late th century lift music written by three gorgeous clones oh and some bloke drippy pap no tune no talent this is the only product i have purchased on amazon that i have been unhappy with i was looking for a replacement treo screen saver i purchased this only to discover it was very thin had no anti glare protection and did not fit despite the seller advertising it for my specific phone the warranty is a sham since if you remove the protector from the card it comes on it becomes void doing so is the only way to see if the protector fits i paid as much for this as a factory treo protector i would have been better off saving my money and using saran wrap what junk i bought these for my month old because he started turning the knobs on the stove now we own a ge free standing gas stove with knobs you need to push in and turn to ignite i even tried using two of these kid kushions stacked together and i could still push in and turn on my ranges i don t know what type of oven they work on but they don t work for my oven this text layout is confusing the scenarios are beneficial however the text itself is difficult to follow this text lacks consistent organization unfortunately it is a required text for my master s program otherwise i would have chosen another text to read regarding this subject well i got this because it was my first guitar i have to tell you straight up that this sucks first of all the strings were way to crappy like made out of plastic and they were way to hard to tune if you tune this it comes out of tune in no time the case rips very easy and the strap breaks easy as well the pick s are very bad they are way to big the extra strings are no better then the ones of there i have bought another guitar from guitar center and it was amazing worked perfectly and it was cheap too if you want my advice save up and buy a good one from guitar center because this is crap this is perhaps the worst batman cartoon of all time whoever put this on tv should be beaten with a sock full of pennies i would not buy this album if it were the last album left on this universe first of all who is singing is this vol for american idols greatest hits or is this a cd for karaoke if i were justin i would sue is this a collaboration with ashton kutcher and britney spears to punk justin this cd is a joke please donate your money to me and i will make a better cd i was expecting alot from this movie after being wowed by sympathy for mr vengeance and oldboy i eagerly anticipated this movie thinking it would at least begin to hold a candle to the others boy was i wrong this film completely failed to capture or hold my attention i was certain i was at fault so unfortunately i tried watching again nothing i want the time i wasted on this cheap cash in back i want my life back the only reason i didn t give it star is because i didn t fall asleep during viewing either time although i now wish i had there s enough going on to keep it mildy entertaining if you re easily entertained like me but not enough to make me like the movie in the least bit i hope the people responsible for making it come to their senses and come out with another oldboy soon the fate of korean cinema may hinge on it i loved baby mozart and my family including the baby were quite fascinated with it the first times or so however i resented baby bach because i did not like watching the video makers daughters in it i felt the place for them was in their own home videos not in my home let their grandparents appreciate them to me they held no interest there was no theme i liked the way baby mozart used the same toy for one song here you got snippets of toys and musical instruments and someone elses children the music was pretty i did not like the way the video was made this product is massively annoying i was forced to purchase it as it was the company standard among the problems the keyboard is too small resulting in many misdialed numbers and mistyped entries the side buttons for controlling the volume are far too easy to accidentally push resulting in constant adjustment of phone and unit volume why in the world aren t they locked out when the keyboard it locked out the accessories are the cheapest of cheap junk the cables do not seat well in the product and the desktop cradle is a total waste of money and i ve stopped using it all together because most of the time the unit will not connect to the laptop in the cradle without massive fiddling with the cable i will never buy another palm product again this book was absolutely terrible it is memorable as one the few books i ve ever just thrown away without finishing preditable and absurd where do i get a refund i have seen this movie in france when it first came out and was very thrilled to be able to get a dvd copy however even though it was advertized as being in french language i was disappointed to receive a movie very poorly dubbed in english would be thrilled if it is released in its original form and would buy it without second thought as it is one of the best suspense movies i ever seen abgd rvw i must concur with the majority on this book james patterson s work in the fantasy genre is terrible the story moves quick enough but thats not enough to make this book good the brevity of the chapters along with the unbelievability of the story the way it was written would have made this book easy to pass up had i believed all the reviews and that mr patterson could write this bad i would have passed it up recommend no purchase possibly one of the most boring books ever had to put it down after about page and i rarely ever abandon a bookno point or plot it just never went anywherei ve never read baldacci before just going by reviews so i picked it off the shelf maybe this is one of his earlier efforts this book is such a waste that it is hard to describe mr moore choses to fill his book with opinions disguised as facts and misses the truth at least of the time while the pictures of sweet toddlers in classic colors and designs is tempting don t bother with this book or other debbie bliss books i am currently making the eylet dress and had to make an appointment with my yarn store s knitting doctor even she couldn t make sense out of the instructions on the neck shaping so with her help i am now winging it this woman also told me that i was the nd person she helped just this morning with a debbie bliss pattern and another employee also told me that she has trouble with db patters as well trouble is there are no diagrams as to what size the pieces are supposed to come out after spending on yarn and for a book of designer patterns i don t expect to be winging it needless to say i will never buy a debbie bliss book again goldberg s weird definition of fascism was customized to make it possible to say things like this the quintessential liberal fascist isn t an ss storm trooper it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from brown or swarthmore but that s just loony if goldberg had written at the end he d have o brien saying if you want a vision of the future imagine a daycare worker giving a toddler a sugarfree bran muffin forever or how about this a hug is liberal fascism s equivalent of a pistol shot to the back of the head you can have infinite fun with goldberg who was the first liberal fascist for example wasn t it cardinal biggles with his terrifying comfy chair the outside of the box makes it look like you get cards by saying additional cards all you get for your money is cards and cheap plastic dots what a rip off i tried to connect two hoses for my pond this adapter does not work the spacing for the adapter does not allow it to join both hoses i am a student at the university of michigan and have taken his bioanthro course while i agree with many of the concepts and theories presented in the textbook it is often times tedious even when used as a reference i stopped reading the assigned chapters and used it as only a reference which still proved difficult because many key terms were left unexplained i would not recommend the book or the course as wolpoff is often times unclear and disprganized i was so excited to try this item when i ordered it but when i got it i was so disappointed because it didn t work it didn t even turn on i didn t try to return it because i was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item i won t order this product again but will try ordering from amazon again what we have here is a collection of cute stories naked couple talking to snakes father sacrificing his son man swallowed by whale grandpa builds a boat etc completely mixed up with long census reports a metric crap ton of genealogy and a strange collection of passages condemning everything from poly cotton blends to facial shaving the central premise of the first half of the book the relationship of the cleverly named sky god god and the hebrews changes drastically in the second half when god impregnates a teenager with himself and begins waxing philosophic about lilies and fish and sheep and camels and needles loooooooong story short some good ideas and a really sexy little section in song of solomon i mean that crap is hot but terribly written with serious continuity problems this book is actually fairly well written compared with a lot of the anti mormon literature that s out there however one can safely assume that ms scott s being dear janed by the lds boyfriend who introduced her to the church was the driving factor in her becoming disenchanted with it thus while it is true that ms scott spent some years as a member of the mormon church she probably isn t the most objective of sources it s curious that she gives the obligatory first person account of the mormon temple endowment ceremony even though one must assume she never actually witnessed it herself inasmuch as single women who didn t have missionary calls rarely received their endowments in her day the irony of it all is that the boyfriend later became a general authority in the church which points up the fine line that can exist between being the wife of a honcho in the mormon church and a bitter author of anti mormon literature jane roe venus williams madeleine albright sheryl crow whoopi goldberg billie jean king i m not sure aldulterers baby killers and lesbians generally come to mind as ladies women of grace poise dignity and beauty yet these are only a few of the women the two authors claim we should all try to emulate it took tremendous willpower just to read the two prologues one by each author and by that time i had had more than enough of their selfish offensive opinions neither of these two women qualify as ladies by their own admission and their guidelines should be avoided by everyone who actually seeks to become more ladylike in spite of its semi witty title and being written in cartoon style this is not a funny book the author is very honest sometimes painfully so about her reactions to being told she has cancer how having it affects her relationships with the people in her life her experience with her treatments and her thoughts on having cancer in generalthe way she copes is to permenently plant herself in front of the television and become obsessed with tv guide crossword puzzles her utimate conclusion is that knowing you are going to die takes all meaning out of life memories and past accomplishements are empty of significance and there is no point in incurring new experiences what she was planning on living for ever we are all going to die someday and we some of us anyway are bound and determined to make the most of the life we have as a cancer survivor so far myself i do not recommend this book to anybody looking for humor hope or cheer overhyped underdeveloped shrot linear plot storyline where fluid was promised terrible amounts of micromanagement ai on the creatures is not adaptive just rote canned behaviors that you can enable or disable save your pennies kids there s much better out there i was excited to read this book based on a recommendation however the pace of the book was just too slow for me to really enjoy it the plot is plausible but once again the story progresses just way too slooooow this is the rd one of these we have had my wife likes them because she can shower without getting her hair wet the first two failed when water would come out the sides of the head and not through it the third one just a month old suddenly would not flow any water through it and the flex tube would not stay in the desired position these two problems may be related we had to throw it away tracks minutes re records and universally bad thin sounding uninviting and minimal effort donovan born donovan philips leitch may is still in good voice and one can still enjoy listening to arrangement here is off freddy and the dreamers lead singer freddie garrity november may had a wonderful voice he sounded terrific even here the supporting band much less so gerry and the pacemakers lead singer gerard gerry marsden september still has a great set of pipes and excellent here again the backing band is not up to the task the track were number s hits in england and monster hits in the usa but nothing here is close to the original tunes and pretty forgettable i picked this up in order to help complete my collection of cyberpunk films in the back of my mind i was hoping for additional footage cut scenes etc there is nothing extra here at all a very poorly done full screen cut and piss poor menu s hopefully one day the dvd will come out in the us will all the additional footage and story additions sadly i m not holding my breath i don t know if roxio has fixed any of the nightmarish problems of previous versions but you might want to read user reviews before you purchase any software from this company caveat emptor easy cd creator platinum cost me and will not install nor will it update it used to install and then the engine would fail there are better ways to waste hours of your time than trying to figure out why software doesn t work cut and run to nero for a minute simple unimaginative chair workout are you kidding me of course this is not mentioned in the advertising this is worth about or could be on three pieces of paper with stick figures and cost nothing harper and model mom must be laughing all the way to their swiss bank please don t give them more of your money until he and mum produce something of integrity and substance this is a blatant rip off which could have easily been avoided by selling it cheaper or adding some meat and potatoes i get nauseated and have fits every time i think of the joel harper s fit pack chair workout bleeck it s fun great to play with on hardwood or tile floor i don t think it works on low pile carpet as it claims but it provides good indoor fun and exercise with minimal danger to people walls and furniture update i liked it so much that i bought one for my nieces and nephews but theirs never worked i don t think they ever bothered to attempt to return it this is my second one of these and the handle on this one broke after months on the first one the plastic ring that holds the whils together broke within a year shame because i love the look and feel and function of this tea kettle but function doesnt mean anything if it doesn t function but i have just spent hours goign trhough every tea kettle that amazon and others offer i am going to try copco s one touch i think i have had it before a few years back and was very happy with it unfortunately amazon does not carry it in black so i have to look elsewhere it would be really nice if this included a list of the movies that are actually y know on this dvd i d hate to buy blind only to find out that i already own half the films and have no interest in the other half i recieved the tub as a gift and thought it was great until the first bath i gave my newborn son was awful the tub leaked all over the counter he also kept slipping around the sling was not much of a help it actully lifted him out of the warm water and he cried because he was cold i would not recomend this tub we finally found the perfect bath accessory the comfy bear sponge we just place the sponge at the bottom of our bath tub with of warm water no slipping and my son loves his baths now i recieved my light via ups and the difusser has a crack in it i called the company explaining the problem they told me it happens alot we ll send a new one out to you right away the guys name was gary gerry whatever his name could have been bozo and i would have respected the company more if they had done what they promised now i have a light with the same problem that i was replacing my old light with has the mildest heating effect you could ever have and legally call a blanket terrible terrible product stay away i bought two of these worked fine for one camping trip that was it expensive for a disposable save your money better stuff out there this burneverythingoven was horrible i purchased it a local retailer and promptly returned it for a full refund it burned toast on the lowest setting and caught my tunovers on fire big disappointment i do not recommend mi criterio fue que nunca me llego el producto quisiera saber que ocurrio y gracias

mission this is not the black stallion the original movie but a cable series and nowhere on your info is that stated i think you should be more detailed in your description i ordered one to keep and one to send to a friend i m glad i didn t have it shipped directly to her i ll be blunt if you liked this book you are an idiot you know nothing about good writing or about the bible i made it of the way through before i tossed the book against the wall the charactors are made of wood got sick of the cliche bad guys and cliche cops and got relly tired of all the facts being distorted or just plain wrong what a waste of time the more i hoped it was going somewhere the more nowhere it went unless the link to nutrition is incorrect i cannot believe that a soup that gives you of your daily max of sodium in a half cup serving can be called low sodium some people with health issues are targeting a daily max of only mg this is deceptive advertising this camera started falling apart feature by feature the minute i started taking pictures thankfully amazon gave me a full refund it didn t help me even a little in fact at times it made me feel a little sicker it was a waste of money and i was very disappointed quickly makes up to cups the timer is much to complicated to set it s easier to fill pot the night before and just press the button in the morning i only use the pot saturday and sunday mornings at just under two years it stopped making palatable coffee the pot stops perking way before the coffee is done plastic top has been cracked almost since the beginning buttons are deterioting also after reading all the other reviews i doubt if i ll buy another kudo s to amazon though it was easy to find out when i bought the pot we used these bottles for our first child they weren t my choice but my mother in law bought them and we were stuck should have switched so much work was involved in cleaning them then the plastic discs would get clogged and we had to soak them in bleach every so often which made me worried it was such a bummer when i would pour formula into the bottle thinking everything was put together correctly only to have the formula liquid gold to us leak out all over the counter after all of that our son still spit up ugh we are expecting our second child soon and i refuse to go through that hassle again i am going to try something else even though we have so many of the other bottles from last time quite a disappointment it doesnt really sense your feet or anything you have to put all the data manualy it doesnt turn on off automatically but you have to kick press a button also can t switch to kg i didnt get consistent results lb which is not accurate returining this bad purchase i bought this unit to replace a d link dkvm k one because i wanted the four channel model and because the price was right you get what you pay for after disconnecting a d link kvm switch that works flawlessly and connecting the tk k switch neither of my desktop computers would access my wireless router d link even though my laptop which i am using now works perfectly with the wireless router trendnet does not have a tollfree number and i have called ten times on my nickle east coast to west coast and all i get is a recorded message that no one is available to take your call stick with a known quantity and buy a d link or linksys unit i ll try to get my money back from buy com the cabinet is more cherry looking to me but others have told me that it is mahogany this looks odd to me the big problem was the quarter sized mark in the finish on the front door looks bad i wouldn t buy the cabinet for this money again this edition does not properly display diacritics on some of the letters specifically all derivations of c this is a function of the text encoding on kindles that means that they can only display western languages in croatian this means that several letters are all being written as one as if an english reading textbook were printing j f and d all as f and you were supposed to learn how to read from that buy the hard copy the item is damaged in new box water flow out of it i can only store little water to avoid water touching the damaged hole i request to change items but they reply that the item is delivered directly from the factory so they don t accept change or return i was expecting a lot more from this knife but this is one case of you get what you pay for i dont recommend this knife because the feel is cheap pay a little more and get a nice knife to chop or cut i cook a lot so i need something that is comfortable for my hands and this is not it try the rachel ray furi east west knife more expensive but worth it i replaced a year old undercounter with this one the wheel is small and uses a fixed cutter instead of a rotating one as result cuts are slow jagged and often stalls the motor very hard to get a can started its going in the trash i heard j davis got voice lessons cant you tell boy from the first single i thought it was korn featuring robert plant his voice is amazing and fieldy is getting so much better at the bass and the head guy is shredding out beautiful power chords korn rocks i ve never been to a korn show but if my mother ever let me go i would meet my boys of korn and ask them how come they are so remarkably talented and how davis can get his voice to sound like he was being pinched by a crawfish korn will save rock and roll we need more bands like korn well wait i shouldn t complain we do have paparoach limp biscuits you get my point real music fans love korn let me rate the songs for all you here to stay terrible an absolute mockery of everything rocknroll once stood for make believe terrible davis whines like my sister blame this is music how do they figure hollow life stop whining already please i really wanted to like this book i loved breakfast of champions but in cradle i didn t connect with any of the characters or the story and though i usually enjoy parodies of religion and apocalyptic themes i thought the whole bokononism thing was dumb and unoriginal too many ideas and concepts were forced into this book none having a meaningful impact i only got through the first pages and i m the type who always finishes books no more life s too short this is a review of the uncut version this story begins very well and develops as a very intriguing sci fi thriller with an unusual sense of empathy half way through part though it veers into a strange psychological treatise on sexuality religion family and cult life and part is hopelessly meandering unreal and verbose i regret reading the uncut version as i m sure the editing made for an improved version with more focus it seems as though the author put the book down for a prolonged period of writer s block and when he finally came back the story went way off course he should have opted for some swift interplanetary warfare for a much better ending a fully regrettable purchase amateur in every respect i wish it were a book then i could rip the pages out and put them to use one at a time don t waste your money when i saw this movie i was so grateful that the producers didn t waste any money on screenwriters directors or actors they sunk every penny into special effects isn t that what america wants this has got to be the biggest piece of i ve ever had the displeasure of owning i can t believe eureka would even sell a hunk of junk like this much less for over if you want a vaccum cleaner that actually works don t buy this one it has no suction whatsoever in addition every last bit of it will fall apart within a matter of weeks i will never buy a eureka product again ever and caution all of you out there to just stay away from eureka as well save yourself a complete waste of time and skip this movie anywhere you see it playing it is the worst ski movie ever made there s a formula to a successful ski flick and this one completely missed the mark very disappointed in this product did not like tone in which it was written and did not appreciate some of the insinuations was looking for a factual run down summary of each of the books of the bible to use in conjunction with bible study but this couldn t do the job go with the macarthur bible commentary http www amazon com gp product ref oh details o s i instead a much better choice these arrived very promptly but they seem to have languished on the shelf for months given how stale they were i can t recommend that these be purchased from any reseller but water skin s supply seems way past the shelf life of the product this is not a time release formulation it is nature s bounty product no and if you check on their web site you will see that it is not time release i was not able to find any time release melatonin on the nature s bounty web site at the time of this review this is actually quite a good book that provides a rather broad overview of different aspects of net however i do not feel i can recommend the book unfortunately because the support website with example code promised on the back cover and in the book does not exist i do not think this is justified at all given the book s age there is example code in the book of course but it is an incomplete excerpt of what is supposed to be on the website the publisher has declined to reply to a e mail message asking about the missing website i bought this based on the reviews on amazon looked like a nice percolator we took it camping i noticed the first time we used it that the plastic handle was loose i bought a camp screwdriver to tighten it unfortunately the handle came completely off the second time we used it it looked like it was glued on don t think that glueing a plastic handle to metal constitutes durable construction i don t recommend this product or any with a plastic handle returned this and am looking for a better made metal handled percolator to replace this joke of a coffee pot with totally lame to lose the handle on our trip don t buy this cheaply made product i have never been so totally ripped off before the dvd s were supposed to be new they were junk most of them wouldn t play at all some crackjed as they were being removed from the case the case looked new but was an obvious knock off the real ncis dvd s come in a totally different case i was really taken do not like this new coffee maker at all the carafe does not keep the coffee hot and the lip on the inside of the carafe is too big you never empty the pot completely i would rather have a glass carafe with a heater under it instead of the stainless steel carafe will never buy again here s another reason not to buy a book by its cover jacket exclaimed how this was in the bernard cornwell sharpe series tradition but it s about the poorest excuse for a historical novel that i ve come across wooden characters and dreadful dialogue makes this more of a battle to finish the story than a story about a battle action scenes are unbelievable and motivation of the people in this story are comic book like i cannot understand how the editorial process allows this garbage to be printed other than that it was great bob i used this splitter to connect a ps and an xbox optical audio to my only port on my receiver when the signals were sent through the splitter the outgoing signal was too weak to send a signal through to the receiver each of the wires worked correctly independently but when put through this splitter it appears that the red light was too weak to send the proper signal to output any sound i like the thinkthin products and had good luck with a shipment of the peanut butter ones but these brownie crunch ones arrived in poor condition from my best guess it looks like they were stored someplace that was hot enough for their chocolate coating to melt each one is splotched with white the chocolate is brittle and flakes off immediately and bears imprints of the outer wrapper exactly as if they had melted and then re solidified they need to be stored someplace much cooler they tasted fine but were a huge mess and very unappealing to look at my first rice book the writing style character development and idea were so impressive that it had the pontential to join the list of books i consider masterful i was majorly let down by two shortcomings the first was the length of the documentary style writing the history was great but it became tedious when presented in documentary form for extended time the other thing and it s hard to explain without spoiling anything was the ending the ending isn t satisfactory because it leads into the next book but the next book seems to be an entirely different type of tale a type i find too way out for my liking shame if you are new to webservers and are trying to set yourself a windows apache server do not i mean do not buy this book it skims through the apache examples and gives very little assistance it does not separate windows from linux so you can clearly follow what it is that you are supposed to do it is out of date on downloading from the apache website and leaves you with no idea if you have downloaded the correct version or not i installed uninstalled apache and read the chapter many times in the hopes that had missed something i never got it to work i will be trying to return it although i opened the cd as a last resort and still did not find the assistance that i seeked i am very disappointed with sams for allowing this book to be published more resources should go into getting apache up and running the troubleshooting is a joke it assumes many things for a beginner this book is appalling i have the indian version and it is sloopily put together as well as dated in addition it is hardly ethical in any sense of the word when the author suggests that you use your isp to hack in addition i have found script references in the book that are not written by the author and yet he doesn t identify this fact he leaves them as if he wrote them further some chapters are nothing more than just a cut and paste from existing websites that are not the author s work if i was the publisher i would be looking more deeply into this author s credibility if you are serious about security get a book like if you just want to be a script kiddie this will do you fine i purchases this program for my granddaughter she is a computer wiz and thought there would be no problem there is really no instructions to explain how to use the program so we found it kind of hard to play the sender was great and it got here very quickly and no problems with that first off a caution this is an inferior product i don t know if i have a dud of this cd but the volume of all the tracks are lower than anything else i have in my music collection it s my fault for not listening to it first i guess but that s how i ve gotten into all the bent material i trust their aesthetic but other than the bent songs i found nothing memorable or standout on this disk monotonous pimpish glam disco funk without soul maybe i just couldn t hear it this is a review of this blu ray transfer and not the movie itself i preordered this great film and have looked forward to the restored version of this classic coming to blu ray but boy what a disapointing transfer the sound is great but the quality of the picture transfer is lousey to say the least it looks a lot better on dvd at least it does on my inch vizio tv both sides of the picture are out of focus and lack color be sure you rent this before you buy to see how it looks on your system i am very disapointed with cbs fox for ruining this film if any of you remember the fox tod a o release of oklahoma on dvd and how bad it looked this is another disaster by fox it is a warner brothers picture but rights have returned to cbs who sold the film rights to wb buyer beware i made a lot of bread loaves a week or more for months satisfactorily on this machine then the paddle spindle metal apparently wore out and the last loaf i made a white with rye the paddle went flying times during the knead i was so disappointed this started happening about at month and just got worse also i do not like the rise i get with this machine really seems to need more time loaves were often short no matter how much tinkering i did with the recipe buying something else amazon won t take it back and i m not paying to send it to cuisinart i used this camera a handful of times i noticed that the lcd and viewfinder was black i was able to hear audio but no video i did some research and found out sony had a lawsuit against them regarding the ccd on some of their cameras well they refused to fix the dcr hc because it was not on their list but the problem was exactly the same i will never buy another sony product again unfortunately after owning this set for months it has developed a blue haze in the upper right and upper left corners of the screen it seems that this issue has appeared in several sony rear proj lcd models including this one it s very expensive to repair and seems to stem from dust infiltration which is inevitable the cost of repair exceeds half of the origainal purchase price lamps are expensive as well perhaps a full lcd set would be a better choice i e sharp or vizio with no moving parts this movie is sooooooooooooooo stupid what is the point in teaching your kids nasty stuff there shouldn t even be a movie like this out there these fruit snacks don t taste good in addition i bought pack of and they sent me only boxes of thus only i m not happy with dishonest service i used this light for months before the bulb burnt out with my biggest complaint being it doesn t produce nearly as much light as my sun system hps lumens vs then i went shopping for a new bulb and realized this is where the w hps wins hands down the feliz cfl k i found was plus shipping while a new ultrasun is plus shipping so for more than twice the price you get half the light if you re worried about vegging in the red spectrum don t be the lumens per watt and cost savings on bulbs more than make up for it i finished this book because i am persistent the writing seems to be episodic the author thinks of the most unlikely thing to have happen and then makes it happen although i know this is fiction i always expect a certain amount of credibility so why does a young woman who has been employed for several years and who is supposed to be quite intelligent have only enough money saved to buy a car that won t start and leave town for destinations unknown and how can she arrange an adoption in one afternoon with a sleazy lawyer i know that this is meant to include single mothers independent women helping the great unwashed the plight of refugees native americans abandoned children and domestic abuse but it seems pasted together and the characters fail to make me care about them i think because this was his first it was awful but i have seen a lot of his comedy it gets better c thomas howell and judd nelson was this made in what was gary coleman busy beware asylum movies do not buy it i bought this product in may collectable i rarely use it and when it used i m extremely careful the dvd surface is clean and perfect but the movies don t work it s not worth it i like the keyboard as a very basic cheap and portable option unlike what is pictured i received a dark grey keyboard that has no illumination what so ever since i ordered it for the illuminated feature i m disappointed it s functional for what it is a flexible silicone keyboard worth bucks nothing more or less i bought this machine to make espresso drinks at home but instead i have a very expensive coffee machine that does not make good espresso the convenience of the machine is wonderful easy to clean easy to fill etc but since i wanted espresso i was disappointed the espresso that it puts out is weak and does not have that espresso bite but tastes pretty good with hot water added to it to make an americano if you want this type of conveinience this is a good machine but if you want true espresso you will have to go with a semi auto and good grinder wish i had packaged up for return within minutes of opening it i thought installation was so easy maybe i was missing something but i wasn t i put the old bulb back in and the tv worked fine there s a few minor differences on the construction of this unit that might have changed the way it fits the quality of this lamp was disappointing the bowl of the lamp is made of what looks like cheap grade plastic the pole section of the lamp came in three or four parts one of those parts had a defective thread so that the section which was supposed to be screwed on top of that one would not screw in straight or even all the way overall the product felt like it was too cheaply made for the price i returned this product and received a refund provided little to no heat and i live in mississippi it wouldn t even take the december chill off definitly not worth the price i returned the vornado and purchased a much less expensive holmes heater which produces three times the heat i wanted to enjoy this film but found the characters a little too obvious relying on music to further the story became a little trite it could have been better also shouting into the abyss was a little too obvious send zach good thoughts but save your money on this one this book was given to me by a friend and it s a great example of christian junk truth a few facts here and some speculation there do not add up to provable fact if this type of selective reality is true i m sure there s a flying saucer chasing hale bopp right now so many zealots have been buying into this nonsense since countdown to armageddon came out in the early s these books are squeezed out by the metric ton and i have yet to come across one that hasn t been totally saturated with disinformation and outright falsehoods i wish i could get the time back that i spend reading this worthless crap this unit leaks at the valve assembly also it does not fit in our new frig planning on replacing with a different model i had this watch for about weeks hardly wore it as i was keeping it for a nice watch when i put it on for the third time i turned out the post to reset the date and the post came off in my hand i cannot set the watch use the watch or even wear it now since both the time and date are wrong i requested a warranty service and they said sure pay to send it here wait a minimum of days and please include a check or money order for to send it back what a rip off i m going to save a ferw hundred more and get a real swiss watch don t waiste your money on this crap i got the book for a course i was taking in my masters program i had taken one linear systems course in my undergraduate while i bought the book new it didn t make it through half of the semester before the binding broke and pages fell out the book omits many useful proofs and if it doesn t omit the proof it expects you to figure out on your own with very little prompting it does have some useful examples but assumes the reader has a very broad and deep understanding about linear algebra and calculus it s very high level and often difficult to follow i am very sorry that i bought this dvd harijiwan looks insane and there is nothing at all about him that is calming he has angry eyebrows screams at you to go faster like a drill sergeant and his inhaling is so loud it just about gave me a heart attack the video is pretty bad quality and there is no music or anything just loud insane breathing the whole time i couldn t even look at his face because he was creeping me out so bad with his eyes rolling all over the place up inside his head i mean can t he close his eyelids i can definitely take the corniness of ana and ravi s dvds any day over this cuckoo i hope i can at least make back some of my money reselling this i bought this game and was really excited to play it roller coaster tycoon works on my computer so i assumed roller coaster tycoon would but it said error rtc blah blah blah has been sent to debug so i looked at system requirements and it said it needed a graphics card for a game wich is rediculous i bet the game itself is great it had better be after to play it do not waste your time or money i should have taken the other star comments more seriously this product is a piece of junk the leaves fell off when rinsing prior to first use tried using one time and many leaves fell off trying to re attach just causes others to fall off i have no desire to bend the tabs further to fix a poorly constructed product i m sending this back this version is so incomplete it is a total waste of money data entry is tedious for periodic contributions such as payroll deductions or church donations there is no way to automatically enter them into the program when adding non cash contributions you are reminded for every single entry if you go over the limits that require you to retain records adding details for non cash contributions requires you to enter data that the irs does not and the date field in that box is badly designed the only useful part of the program value tables for common donated items is woefully small its competitor it s deductible is a far better program don t waste your money absolute junk can t get the plastic parts together don t bother i tried two different kits it leaked anyway really strange bad read i love the first half of the book both characters delightful then we find out viola secret not one i thought was that viola was the earl s and things go down hill from there viola turns mean and nasty ferdinand can t talk sense to her he offers to give her home back not good enough for her he offers to marry and protect her with his family s name still not good enough his sister and sister in law come to talk to her still not good enough come on i really don t understand why ferdinand loved her after she changed it really made no sense i like a book with a lot of drama but it must be believable for me to enjoy it no man s mistress has a sweet ending it the middle of the book ruins it this my first book by mary balogh i don t think i will be buying her books for her name this not the worst book i have read but it s still pretty bad i am a clinical professor in a school of pharmacy and am admittedly biased toward traditional western medicine however any objective person would have to agree that there are major gaps in the information this book provides in the section on st john s wort this book states that there are no known contraindications or drug interactions with st john s wort there are in fact serious drug interactions with this product including anti rejection drugs resulting in at least one case of organ rejection in a renal transplant patient and potentially fatal interactions with other anti depressants most importantly maois this book has extensive information on historical use of herbs pharmacology and uses but lacks important safety information no clinician should use this book as his her sole source of information on herbal products this film reinforces my belief that some books cannot be translated to film the depth of imagination required to follow and appreciate the intricate interweaving of the ulysses story plot action can only as far as i know be achieved within the human mind the movie industry simply doesn t have the technology to achieve such a feat on the screen this was a valiant effort but my anticipated visual bloomsday felt more like a doomsday this product looses power constantly the batteries don t make good contact and anytime the camera gets a bump or a shake it powers off when it does that in the middle of a recording you don t even get to keep what you ve already recorded it shows it as an unknown file and there s nothing you can do except delete it i sent it in for repair and when i got it back it still did the same thing i don t know if they did anything to it or not but i don t bother using it anymore as i ve lost so much that i thought i had recorded it would have been a great product if it weren t for that the information contained in this so called biography is available on the internet free of charge and certainly not worth the price i paid to download it i would not recommend this to anyone in this cd it seems like good riddance want to sound more like strung out then have there own sound but songs like come dancing a credit to his gender and steps are awesome songs then there follow up cd to this ones is the best the songs really stunk this old prune couldn t write a song if it bit him on the butt what he did to the songs was murder he was trying to be something he isn t he should just go back to the retirement home and have sponge baths i ordered this book last year you are still promising delivery on december rd this appears to be the only way i can get to you where is the book where the previous volume of this series felt like a great introduction this book feels leaden half the time the author feels like he s still setting up the setting but nearly every character or setting he introduces is destroyed right away in the end only jessica sorrow remains of the new characters introduced to return in the future author simon r green hopscotches from one encounter to another a psychic boy band a dancer who lives by stealing vitality from the undead a gun that works by undoing god s creation only to have the lead prove fruitless and the characters in question be destroyed this feels less like a mission or a quest than a scavanger hunt at a spastic child s birthday party green has a wonderful setting in the nightside and compelling sympathetic characters in john taylor and suzie shooter here s hoping that in future installments he rambles less and narrates more an executive plaything that can t do what a buyer wouldexpect garmin s mapsouce products are oudated inaccurate andoverpriced the etrex does all that this unit can do and it ishalf the price remenber keep it simple stupid this was the most boring book ever and i can t believe i had to buy it only to read one or two chapters its an okay book my only problem is the author provides a lot of scripts and selling techniques that use lies to manipulate people for example he recommends pretending you may want to buy a home as a personal investment when calling of fsbos who advertise no brokers its also a very old book and some of the stuff that worked in the s doesnt work any more i ve owned this saw for a year the price of this saw is its main appeal it s also portable however it has many drawbacks the miter slot is loose and inaccurate attaching a wooden fence to the miter gauge amplifies the problem the saw is very loud you ll need ear plugs to use it for an extended period of time the fence is quite poor and pains must taken to ensure it s parallel to the blade after every adjustment ensuring the blade is parallel to the table is also a frequent activity as it frequently moves after use the blade guard is also lousy requiring as with all other parts on this saw frequent adjustment overall this is a cheap saw that can be used with some success if you understand the limitations and have a lot of patience i agree that clueless george was a well written piece of political satire however you should know if you bought it that just as g w bush duped us as a country you were duped by buying it the writer of the books stole it from the initial writer and published it under his own copyright sound familiar america every single time we have used it it has spilled out all over the stove and made a huge mess threw it in the trash eventually do not waste your money on this i wish i could give it a zero star rating this book is junk and waste of our natural resource it is useless i agree with the comments about the taste and size personally i think someone should look into the false advertising on the preztel kit which is also a pack you only get two pretzels one of the packs is salt and another is glaze then you get two packs of some pretzel dough these pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine total rip off hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff too bad there s not a zero star option i bought this primarily for a kitchen radio the tuner and volume knobs are so smooth and so tiny you can barely turn them certainly not with wet or sticky fingertips the tuner is analog not digital so you re lucky to tune in a station at all it s impossible to avoid interference nor is it an option to set it to mono to cut the background hiss i suppose the cd player works and sounds fine so i ve put it in the laundry in case i ever get around to ironing if not taking it to the consignment shop will likely cost less than shipping it back for another terrible album it has a couple of songs that sound like kid rock s style most of the songs are very very country if i wanted willie nelson i d have bought willie nelson usually rock fuzes rap and metal in this album he tries to bring country in too in a big way and i think it fails the song lonely road of faith appears to be pandering to the sept tragedy as a new marketing opportunity in fact it makes me suspect of the entire work it makes me wonder if the new direction to fuse with country isn t driven by the marketing execs rather than a true desire on kr s part to go country overall the album was preachy and country if kr keeps this direction it ll be the last album for me i m sorry i wasted my money on this one and i hope i can save others the disappointment its difficult to appreciate a book written in the style of no wave dadfa enhanced mutuality before the settlement of refugees the methods of training in this book are outdated and are not aligned with acceptable practices of do no harm to the dog there are many ways to train dogs with positive reinforcement other than what is suggested here like some popular personalities who are not using updated behavior techniques this author misses the mark i can t recall if it was this book or his other one where he hits the dog s paws for jumping on the fence there is no need to hit a dog to train it even with beautiful strong breeds like the shepherd you can establish respect for humans without alpha rolls and dangerous practices like hitting the dog i recommend victoria stilwell as an author who truly knows modern positive training methods despite one very negative review i took a chance on two boxes but immediately returned one two stars is generous i tried it on my hp which model number is not among those listed on the box and in marketing material as not among those printers for which this paper is optimized this double negative unwinds this way for me this paper is worse than lighter less expensive generic printer paper the image quality is no better the print quality is worse the heavy weight offsets the advantage of two sided printing and the double glossy paper jambs my printer s feeder i would be embarrassed to issue a brochure of the quality i was able to produce i ll revert to generic glossy premium photo paper to display photos and text the sheets remaining of this foul purchase may end up as packing material the book has much information but it is not in a very logical format when you need an equation to use a look up chart don t expect to find one the charts in the book are useful but you really have to know what is going on ahead of time not a good book to learn from using this book as a reference book when taking a test is not a good idea i wish these people would have put at least the odd answers in the back of the book with out the answers especially when your teacher doesn t go over hw with you you have no clue how to do the problems what einstein thought that showing a christmas tree for minutes constitutes marketing this as a christmas movie cutesy but boring plot and quite forgetable thank heaven i have learned to rent first before buying like trouble i finished this book wholly unsatisfied the denouement left several plot points completely unresolved and screams sequel although scott s characters engage the attention her endless descriptions of netwalking become quite monotonous because the adversaries are not full characters but constructs when cerise and trouble finally vanquish them it s just not very interesting this book put me to sleep several times colin farrell looks better as a secret agent than his muscle bound counterpart but this movie lacks the comic charm of that one i knwo the story is different but as a fan of the st you wait to see if there are any similarities over few i will say that the tech used in this movie is awesome that s about it sorry kiddos i had looked at a copy of this book at a seminar i attended on bee health and decided to order my own copy from amazon it started out very good well written and had all the makings of a fine account of one persons spiritual path however the whole thing dropped dead when the bee mistress made her appearance and it got steadily worse there are a lot of books on shamanism with much to offer the reader in enlightenment i notice the whole string of reviewers their reviews were polite the book continues to spiral downward into a cheap porn novel i have now purchased casico illuminator digital watches everyone has suffered a broken harness on both sides of the watch some watches last a year my most recent watch broke yesterday less than a month since i bought it ironically all the watches themselves still keep perfect time some more than five years later understandably i will not be buying this watch again ms wilder creates a world which she expounds upon throughout her next two novels yorath the wolf the summer king this is not the best written nor the best conceived fantasy which i ve ever had the privilege of encountering however if you have the time happen to encounter it the i d recommend reading this series the books have their draggy parts but overall there are some very interesting premises imaginative techniques employed can be sometimes very unpredictable the author writes well and has done a great job revealing the hidden homeless of new york city but i found the content of the chapters to be highly repetitive of the same ideas the homeless who live underground are different than other homeless they are drug users and or mentally ill in general they live in horrible conditions they are treated poorly by each other and by often by whomever they come in contact with police etc for an eye opening view borrow it from someone to read to take it out from the library but it s not worth the money to buy unless possibly you re work is in this area this book was not at all useful as a travel guide it s not very useful as a story either the author is self involved self important and describes things we d rather not know like his sexual exploits just look at his picture and you ll know why he s into wine women and cigars in a very annoying way he complains a lot and seems to have an inability to roll with the punches he is basically a sexist bore look elsewhere for a better read and info on new zealand i loved i claudius and i was really looking forward to reading claudius the god unfortunately i felt that this one pales in comparison to the original the story of herod agrippa at the beginning of the book was very interesting but graves rapidly gets bogged down in tedious details as he describes claudius reign he has a tendency to delve into anecdotes and engage in needlessly complex narrative structures although there are some amusing and interesting stories spread throughout i felt graves took way too much time building up exposition and describing every little detail overall i was disappointed with claudius the god and vastly prefer the original i bought this for my son for christmas only one hatched and lasted a whole weeks then died something about the cut of these shorts doesn t work well with this fabric i like code four s prices but i d recommend sticking withcode four athletics cascade team soccer shortsor another of their mesh shorts when we attended this guy s seminars three years ago just about all his cures involved hot towels and enemas now these techniques are not so important either medical science changes even quicker than i thought or this guy is a quack like every kategeek i am always on the hunt for new and rare items to add to the already bloated k t collection be warned if you are anything like me you will be verry disapointed this is a book report of an audio cd with no bush music only a friendly enough voice telling you everything you already know with new age music in the backround if you are a us kate fan you would be better off using the money you could have spent on this disapointment an buy the uk version of never forever the us version has the first bar of babooshka cut out of it i have bought this book thinking it would give information beyond the most known facts and also instructions on how to deal with credit problems i could fix little error on my credit history before reading this book it is totally waste of money come on people how can you stand this movie i have a cousing who hasn t ever seen more than minutes of it because he falls asleep it s not worth the time theres no plot no real purpose to the movie this game is a total flaw it self its garbage it should belong in the bin if you badly like ww shooters then get call of duty double pack it has two call of duty games this game is the dumbest game in the world its a waste of money a waste of money my daughter has had this in her basket of toys since birth she is now months old and has never been interested in it for more than ten seconds the thing is too heavy and cumbersome to be entertaining in any way as mentioned by others you really have to shake the thing hard to hear the giggle and it is not even a pleasant sound but the worse aspect of the toys is that is is so heavy that if a baby holds it while laying on her back and then drops it it is a mighty big thump on her face this happened to my daughter once and it did hurt her i definitely don t recommend this ridiculous toy sounds like a good idea but this thing just does not work very well it s like listening to an fm station that you almost get signal goes in and out while other stations bleed through i returned mine the day after i bought it stick with the old style cassette adapters sorry belkin you tried placed this in a large blooming ocotillo cactus that the hummingbirds had been working i knew the blooms would soone be gone and wanted to keep my birds around never had one try to drink from this feeder tried several reciped as well as red food color without success it does look pretty buy i ve given up on filling it i loved this album when it first came out in a fit of nostalgia i bought the cd the old tape i had owned was long gone alison moyet has a fabulous voice but the music of yaz is now unbearably dated i played the cd once and blushed with embarrassment that i had ever liked this type of electronic pop music read n t writght john meier e p sanders james charlesworth and alan watts borg states he hasn t experienced death so cannot say whether there is an afterlife or not and yet apparently he has experienced god with a political socio economic agenda for a possible finite world a waste of time the book arrived quickly and appeared to be in new condition however as i began to read it i ran into a problem it appears there was an issue when binding the book pages to and missing completely and pages to are printed twice i received excellent custoemr service from amazon when i reported the problem and a replacement book arrived within days of my compliant repalcement book is also new and was boudn crooectly with all pages appearing only once i bought this for a baby shower gift to put all my gifts in i had gotten a similar dark brown one for another baby shower and it turned out really cute however i got this one in the mail and it s orange as orange as a basketball luckily i was able to swap the two and used this one for a baby boy i was reassured the orange would be okay for a boy s gift and used my dark brown one for a baby girl i would have returned it but i would have had to pay shipping to return it plus i had used my amazon prime account to get two day shipping because the baby shower was in just a couple of days i wouldn t have gotten a replacement in time very unhappy this unit caused a usb port surge that shut down all usb operated items keyboards mouse on computers in office unusable due to this issue returning to seller this album should come with a warning label to not listen to it while driving or operating heavy machinery because it will put you to sleep how is this good music if you close your eyes and listen without falling asleep can you picture these songs as radio hits not only was the story depressing the main character was pathetic and stupid i know that sounds harsh but while i want to applaud her for trying to run her farm after her husband s death and for seeing past the color of a person s skin given the times and circumstances staying was a death wish i m sure many others liked or even loved this book however i m just not one of them not only did the main character not set well with me the writing did not engage me in the story jarring switches in the point of view and long overly detailed descriptions i picked this book at the bookstore to while time away and i m very glad i didn t buy it the outline of the plot was appealing but in the end it was mediocre i didn t like the main character all that much and mostly he stayed in the shadow as unknown to us as he was to the family it s also hard to believe that he wasn t revealed as the impostor the odds of pulling that off are very low the story went on at a slugglish pace and the mystery took a backseat most of the time most of the time it was brat going around the estate and meeting people the suspense was nonexistent i think agatha christie is much more interesting also the mystery in this book was weak and quite predictable this cd is worth buying for one reason it s the last recordings of blind owl the rest of the cd sounds like a bar band you could hear anywhere if it werent for the songs with the original band blind owl this would be total trash alas the interviews in this film are ill conceived and poorly shot the stories and ideas are clumsily presented and the volume levels have not been equalised rather read smullyan s wikipedia biography i ll keep it short the reviewer who compared this book to donna tartt s first book has it right they are both embarrassing drivel good idea awfully executed no sense of place at all every thai character of which there are very few is unsympathetic to put it mildly spiv or drugs guard i get annoyed just thinking about how i struggled to the end when i could have been reading something anything else i bought this product two years ago to check the pressure in my motorhome tires it appeared to be a rugged quality product which i thought would work well unfortunately i was mistaken and wish i would have never purchased it due to its construction it is very hard to use on dual rear wheel tires to obtain an accurate reading the bleed valve which i thought was a clever idea never worked properly and if you overfill a tire and have to release pressure i still had to do it the old way the gauge started leaking air where the weaved metal hose attaches to the handle and is now useless i would not recommend this product due to its poor design and quality although the description said that this earbud was for the nokia it was not was not able to connect when inserted into the plug had to return them i thought this would have more potential based on what the back of the box said and how this program compared to the other similar programs i was so frustrated and disgusted by the time i was done not everyone out there has a big sprawling house i have a simple cape that i want to do some remodeling on and this program basically ignores any thing of reasonable modest size so if you have a modest size house don t waste your time or money with this you re better off drawing it yourself with paper and pencil if i could i would give it stars funny that he should mention james herriot which was more or less what i was hoping for despite a few interesting parts and parts that rang true i m also a doc my overall impression was one of bordom the book didn t have much substance or deep meaning sort of a vague diary which was not of general interest with an apology to the author s mother whose opinion he keeps dredging up after reading cos i just decided to read the amazon reviews and summaries and skip the book all together cos and loc dragged on so much that i m moving on to something else one specific comment ditch nynaeve fresh out of the box it started clicking once in awhile then after awhile the clicking kinda stop or softened to the point where i can actually listen to the music then at the end of the day it started clicking real lout constantly until the player spits the adapter out would return it but not really worth the cost to ship it back these earphones sound great and are the most comfortable that i ve come across main draw back the left channel quit working after weeks of use with ipod at no more volume wow great job phillips what a bunch of noobs mine worked literally for five minutes the mic quit searching around the web this was a common occurrence obviously motorola is dumping them on the public they gotta know enough already with the positive reviews how many times can a greatest hits album be re released and there be stupid people around to buy it this might be fine for the super casual fan but for a real true chicago fan this collection isnt much there are two new songs on this compilation here in my heart and the only one i dont own a chicago greatest hits album because some of the best material will not be found on a greatest hits the madness doesent stop with this cd the following year in they would release by they i mean the record company would release the heart of chicago volume with two new songs that are worse than the two on this cd all i can say is avoid this i ll give the book itself five stars but the book i received is not the one shown in the picture above and it s also in very bad shape the cover is creased in a number of places and it s got a worn price tag stuck on the front and it s also the wrong edition the one pictured above matches my copies of han solo and the lost legacy and han solo at stars end and that s the one i wanted this one does not if i weren t so against throwing books away this thing would be going in the garbage i purchased this product about months ago after about uses the unit stopped spraying water i contacted bissell they basically made me take the machine apart and couldn t find the problem they referred me to a service center miles away i brought the unit to the service center and they repaired it during the nd use after the repair it stopped spraying again i took it back to the service center now i have driven miles the service center said that it was issues with the heater and it couldn t be repaired they contacted bissell and a new unit was delivered to the store today i opened the replacement unit to find that obviously this was a return because the power cord had been cut off i have had to drive back and forth to a repair shop and don t have a functioning vacuum this book was supposed to be about the civil war well at least the first two chapters were anyway some of the chapters were funny and the charicters themselves were fun and interesting but other than that i didn t like the book it s two stories into one which is fun but in my oppinion the inman story is funner than the ada story only because the inman stories were adventurous he actually went out of the house ada stayed in the same area at all times wining about how her life was so boring and feeling sorry for her self i wouldn t have read this book if i didn t have to i thought the book was all right i bought this waffle maker for my husband for valentine s day i had read reviews on several different makers but this one seemed to be the best value for the price i made waffles one time and they were great the only problem i had with it at the time is that it is difficult to clean when i took it out weeks later to make waffles for the second time it didn t work i tried cooking a waffle and the bottom was good but the top did not get hot and left a big gooey mess inside the maker i was so disappointed i ended up purchasing an all clad waffle maker from williams sonoma it was a lot more expensive but performs beautifully deeveedee ought to be banned from your site for misleading customers this bd does not play in bd players sold in the us market why not state that clearly i presume the size of the uk vs the us markets have some bearing in their practice please be careful if you want to purchase this product because deeveedee does not assume any responsabilities the and reviews have opposing opinions of this book funny thing is both are right in what they say dyer s biblical overview is accurate but he has little to say about saddam hussein despite the fact hussein is on the cover of the book i sure was expecting more info on saddam hussein than i got now that the persian gulf war is over let s see if those weapons of mass destruction are found in iraq as president bush insisted they would be any bets these clear bumper guards do not use m tape they came off after hrs they also had a slight blue tint to them the glue also looked like bubbles peeled them off before it was to late would peel paint off for sure if given chance to dry if it had m tape i think they would be ok but they can t because m is white and would show black is better choice sorry but this movie was just barely entertaining is it because it has nazi zombies is it because the characters are not your average americans on a road trip but average europeans on a road trip yes it is barely interesting due to these two factors but otherwise there is nothing much left to talk about aside from a couple creative gore scenes nothing original or even well executed here how did this movie make it so far aside from skillful marketing i am a well read fantasy enthusiast and i try not to be too critical of my favorite genre but this story is downright lousy and even worse it is extraordinarily long having read the rings which is of course my all time favorite set terry brooks david eddings c j cherryh steven donaldson and robert jordan i have a deep love for imaginative fantasy but what i detest are flat characters that do not truly change from one end of the book to the other the dudly do right mr naive character that has no inter esting quirks or faults is boring to say the least i don t like his exlanations of magic or his realm of the dead the only thing that caught me was the mord sith episode which did not fit with the rest yuk excluding some rather cool special effects the whole of this movie was dull and boring the plot was confusing a hodgepodge of standard pseudo mystical elements brought out of some attic trunk unless you re just turned on by a rather busty angelina jolie i suggest you save your money i found this book to old to really enjoy i did not like the way the doctors and interns where portrayed i just felt this book was not up to the quality i enjoy reading just like a b movie such a disappointment i love you sjp but to me your lovely perfume smells like nail polish remover in fact i met up with a group of friends and immediately recognized the nauseating smell of this fragrance on a friend s girlfriend after hanging out for a bit one of my guy friends yelled why does it smell like paint thinner in here i was really embarrassed for the girl wearing it hopefully she remained clueless since all noses are different i bought two pair of the length supports just weeks ago to heal my plantar fasciitis they are helping me make progress but the top fabric liner is badly peeling off on both pair already and the edges are badly frayed all around they look terrible and will not perform well anymore with rolled up liner rubbing under my feet i bought them because the doctor said they were more effective and i like that they are american made but c mon this is poor quality my spenco s lasted for years and still look very good connectors shown on the amazon picture are molded onto the cable picture also shows gold plated connectors what actually comes in the package are crimped on nickel plated connectors of much lower quality than those on the picture and they don t look like they are wheaterproof definitely not water proof i had to cut off the ends and get a set of compression connectors s i ordered a mini ipod from amazon back on april the original ship date was june amazon has delayed shipping me the product times now and my latest scheduled ship date is september my recommendation to you is go somewhere else to get the product i m sorry i thought the premise of this novel would be entertaining satirical and worth the price of the book it was anything but this is not a smart bomb attack on academic hypocrisy and cant as the book jacket endorsement states this is a b cluster bomb drop on the usual attitides about men from those who wish to portray them as befuddled confused creatures who could perhaps survive in this world if they weren t being constantly outsmarted and dominated by the superior sex i was more than disappointed by the book after being drawn in to purchasing it buy the commercial hype that we find on this site i think the reader s comments here for the most part are a more accurate portrayal of what awaits this product claims to be supported on win se i installed the provided drivers and still nothing worked i downloaded the most recent drivers from the iogear website tried those and still didn t work meanwhile these drivers screwed up my computer to the point where the display was wacky and in general it hasn t been the same since i will be re installing win se from scratch this weekend to try to undo the damage done by this product drivers also the instructions in the manual apparently did not pertain to the cd of drivers they sent me finally i have to note that the box i received had obviously been opened and returned by someone else i probably should have seen this as a sign of things to come so if you have win look elsewhere i bought the sandisk imagemate it installed seamlessly and works perfectly and costs less than the iogear solution too i can t help but compare josh groban s pbs concert to the latest one shown in december in we saw a confident talented man with a beautiful voice performing with the music and guests in partnership in all of that is gone what we have instead is a failed effort to remake himself into a star but at the cost of his voice it almost seems like pbs and groban filmed this concert as an afterthought no wonder at some points he seems to be singing in the dark groban looks uncomfortable and aware that this is not his shining moment his voice falters often after watching the televised concert i ve decided not to buy this one this is a great loss to me because josh groban was among one of my favorite new artists if he isn t careful his meteroric rise to fame will crash and burn just as quickly if you have read the books this book is a waste of time it mostly sums up the plot and characters and so forth if you have not read the books and do not have time to have any fun since reading the books is lots of fun then this is a quick way to find out what is going on don t be fooled by the old lady and the llama this isn t authentic andean folk music but andean elevator music anything by sukay is better thief of hearts is nearly the same as katherine stone s other books two main couples who deny their feelings for each other until the end and all live happily ever after i must admit that i like her books for the most part but feel that i am reading the same story over and over her characters are always beautiful accomplished and dedicated and so tortured by painful past that they are emotionally unable to function they dwell on the past on almost every page and when not in the past they are imagining some hurt being put upon them by the object of their affection i am beginning to find the stories almost painful to read and want to shake these characters and tell them to get over it already having said all that i admit to being hooked and at least for the time being will continue to read her works i just wish she would come up with some characters who weren t so fragile men and women alike whether it was the un inspiringly one dimensional characters the many boring mundane pages i gritted my teeth to get through the mirror mirror on the wall theme i at first thought was clever but grew very tired of the romance that came about so late in the book that i was indifferent to it the same old same old storyline back at castle mackeltar enough already give us something fresh and new the weak barely there villain the rushed bland ending or the mention of the next two possible books that are going to be the exact same as this one i just could not wait for this one to end perhaps i just don t click with lisa jewell i didn t find this book particularly funny or touching her characters seem dryly typical and the storyline has been done at least it felt like it has been done i wouldn t really recommend it i was disappointed with the flavor of these i really love the taste of nutritional yeast i m a vegan but the only discernable flavor of these doodles was salt i don t know why nutritional yeast is listed as one of the ingredients and the flavor non existent i think it may have been a marketing ploy to entice health nuts and vegans to buy them it s too bad since nutritional yeast is so full of nutrients and flavor if you are a vegan don t waste your money go makes some popcorn and sprinkle some nutrional yeast over it it s much less expensive and healthier than these lousy things i mean tings this the most dissappointing article i have read in a long time it was lightweight and lacked any substance what should have been the heart of this article the process of developing a mission statement was replaced by common sense and cliche passed off as original thought do not waste your money movies are my life i love movies any kind of movie except reality well anything yet i am still trying to figure out why anyone would even produce this one it is hands down the worst so called christmas movie i have ever watched i only got through the entire thing because i kept waiting for something good to happen which by the way never did at least not until the end credits came it was not joyous heartwarming or even remotely close to christmas cheer drugs family despair and hate are not what i call a happy christmas movie i never realized how normal my family was until investing two hours of my life which unfortunately i will never get back into this film so i guess i should thank the people who stupidly put the time and money into this so thank you and have a merry christmas i bought trawler because i had read o hanlon s previous books into the heart of borneo and no mercy and so thoroughly enjoyed them i could hardly put them down by contrast trawler was such a huge disappointment i could hardly bear reading it until i finally put it down for good without finishing it it s full of the kind of fishing and sailing detail of moby dick but without melville s nuance or complexity instead we get an insignificant frenzy of unrelated facts that we might expect from someone in a drug induced state who imagines that each experience during that time is fraught with deep significance it s perhaps telling that early on o hanlon admits that months after the contract was signed he still owed his publisher a book trawler ought to serve as a reminder not to let term papers go unwritten until the night before they re due i was sold on these wipes but after the motor burning out the water pump and the control panel in my month old front load washing machine parts alone were over not to mention labor costs of fortunately i had an extended warranty that helped eat some of the costs all to find out these wipes were the cause found them in the pump drain trap and somewhere else the tech showed me no more will i buy these wipes this collection of short stories is uneven at best and only sporadically entertaining everything that made trevanian one of my favorite authors is all but absent in this book if these stories were indeed written over a period of years they belong back in the author s reject file where they must have come from if they are all new so much the worse i can t imagine that an author who hadn t already proven his marketability could persuade a publisher to foist this thin gruel upon the reading public i am willing to follow a favorite author through any number of genres but not when he abandons the quality of writing that made his work so delightful and readable if you must buy this book wait for it to appear on the sale table first let me start with that i read joshua harris s book i kissed dating goodbye first and so when i read this one i thought ugh to me it felt like this guy was trying to beat around the bush with dating he gave a bunch of tips and nice little anecdotes but it wasn t fulfilling it didn t give the the info i wanted or needed i m kinda dissapointed i spent on this when i could have bought third day s new album i acquired the megastar golden collection release of days of being wild at a relatively low price while the video transfer is quite good the english subtitles are so much of a mess that i had to stop and review several scenes before i could get a sense of the dialog i ve got a high tolerance for the occasional errors in spelling grammar and punctuation found in subtitles on many otherwise excellent asian releases of asian films but the subtitles here are so difficult to slog through that the viewer really comes away with a diminished sense of what the film is about after watching this version i rented the kino release the subtitles are excellent as is the film of course so my advice would be to avoid this one and get the kino also if ordering used be sure that the seller is in fact offering the kino version i ve seen this one for sale on the kino page as well so look closely i bought of these to use on gates in a fenceline i had built paid amazon a total of including s h of the locks worked fine the other would not allow me to reset the combo from after the keys are inserted it would not turn on any of the even after jiggling cajoling and bending the key i am familiar with how these locks are supposed to work but i read the instructions just to be sure i was doing it correctly also wasted about a gallon of penetrating oil on the which would not work and a few hours trying to get them to work as it became a bit of a project never could get the which refused to work at the beginning to work at all and they are completely useless kelly prices latest effort is a prime display of a superior voice with inferior material first of all kelly price should not be singing pop songs or anything close she is one of the very few singers around today that has enormous talent however that talent barely presented itself in a long album of quiet singing and annoying pop tunes this is a singer with the capability as weve seen in the past to tear the house down and take it to church with her powerful unfaltering vocals however she does that on only one yes one of the song son this album and that song is he proposed which in my opinion is the only song on the album worth listening to im sorry kelly i wish i could have revied this better but please stick to relying on ur vocal ability and not catchy tunes to sell ur albums from a truly dissapointed fan the binding here just isn t strong enough i wasn t the only one in my class to buy it and several of us had chunks that would separate from the binding fall out i did appreciate the font size relatively large for a text this difficult though the instructions actually tell you to lift the scale with your big toe and drop it get it going but even this didn t work that well i m not sure my downstairs neighbors will appreciate me dropping the scale every time i want to use it guess i should have read the reviews before buying two of these to replace my aged mousepads at home and at work neither mouse worked when the mousepad was under it i think the material might be too reflective for optical mice though my coworker s optical mouse had no problems mine aren t off brand mice either one is a dell and the other is a microsoft at any rate it s best not to risk it if you have an optical mouse in my opinion it looked interesting being able to shape your hair while drying it perhaps saving an extra step but it turned out to be very awkward it didn t really curl hair well the hair gets caught in the brush unless you are very meticulous about how you wind it up makes hair a little frizzy i would return it except it wouldn t be worth paying the extra shipping i am getting surgery on my right arm and won t be able to use my arm so i will hang on to this as it will at least brush my hair and dry it slowly with one hand at my age i should know that if something looks too good to be true it probably is in that respect this watch did not dissapoint the fine styling and sleek look of the piece made me think that the price was a bargain yet i feel like i bought this off of some guy at a carnival the watch did look great light and sleek and simple to operate i set the time i set the day and clicked it and the second hand began moving i put it on me and love the thin light feel to it i got five minutes from my home on my way to work on my birthday only to discover that the watch ceased working dead as a doornail i do not know if it is merely the battery but a watch that breaks down within min of ownership is not a good sign and for me that makes this junk i am happily returning it for a refund when did inch become inside measurement was only inch and out only now i m left with these drapery rings that are too small to even operate correctly on a inch rod it would cost too much in shipping to return umbra should state exact measurements on the package and advertising i was very disappointed to say the least do not buy this product you will be sorry and out of your money if it needs a repair you are unable to find an authorized dealer or anyone to fix it i had my machine and used it times it never worked well from day three and i am so sorry i did not return it to the store where i purchased it from many other people i have talked to have had the same problem works for three or four uses than bam it breaks i have thrown it out because i cannot find a place to fix this do not use the soap in there as well you need a low suds the soap in there does nothing more than attract more dirt as you cannot clean it good enough it leaves too much soap residue and since the suction stinks on this machine its a huge problem not the entire first season just the first episode of the first season one of twenty six ever produced in very good film to dvd transfer but at slightly under thirty minutes this is not very economical i thought this was a new workout with allie it is old workouts the stage and workoutfits look to be from the s or early i didn t even see allie yet plus there is a segment at the beginning with nudity that i did not appreciate as i have family members who have had a problem with porn in the past no warning re the nudity or anything this really ticked me off i am going to try and return it because it s just not what i was expecting from the firm i have been extremely happy with their transfirmer series but this stinks i threw mine away no matter what i cooked in it it had that new appliance plastic taste i tried everything to get the smell to go away everything i cooked in it went into the trash save your money i ordered this bag based on the title large camera case it is actually a mini case the description and the picture of this item are deceiving it can only fit small compact mini digital cameras i regret order this item i am happy with the product i purchased the digital camera at the same time the problem was when the card did not show up until a week later i needed to use the camera but without the card it s useless sending it regular mail during the holiday season may not have been the best idea i would love to review this book but it has now been eleven months and i still have not recieved it we all go through journies in life it is sad shehas left the church and expresses her opinion s in such a one side way we all have our problems in our catholic faith read the book but remember the church is so huge that one opinion can t form another s not exciting enough jack black executes well but story lacks interesting content for my taste some stories do not need to be retold i didn t like any of the art in the books i didn t like how the pages are divided in half the object is to find bottom page that matches the top page it may be a good idea in theory but pretty bad in real life i just wanted some books to read to my month old i just wanted a numbers book that went from to in order the books are more like flash cards except instead of having a back and front they have a top and bottom section if you want flash cards buy flash cards if you want some books buy something else i have used prima books for years and except for verses bookswhich went out of business they were the best but now i cannot believe how bad this book is it seems that the writers of this book did not even play the game i will think twice about buying any prima product in the future it used to be that the nintendo guides were only so so butnintendo seems to have learned what prima forgot write a decent guide and you will sell more books games if you get any guide make it the one from nintendo i wish the author would have come out with a veuve cliquot diet instead it would have been a lot more fun and equally effective this regime supposedly is all about dragging your groceries here and there eating better and lots of really awful soup some of which may act as a diuretic the beverly hills diet calls for lots of fruit but either way you end up spending a lot of time in the ladies room most french women smoke a lot a lot most of france smokes a lot that revs up one s metabolism and cuts hunger i know of one really famous french model whose secret was an unlimited stash of thyroxin which when taken in huge amounts causes osteoporosis among other things there isn t anything different here in the words of rita mae brown if you wrap a red bow around it this was a pretty bad album it had terrible lyrics and no good song concepts there were or good beats on the whole album but overall its a really bad album i respect benzino for being the first openly gay rapper and for being such an outspoken defender of homosexual rights in hip hop but he doesn t have the skills to rap he should continue his advocacy in the source and the advocate and leave the rapping to the professionals i live in florida and wear them for relatively short periods of the year and indoors i bought them in and by the end of i noticed that the cheap plastic sole material had started to split crack by an entire section of the sole had deteriorated away on one and more more cracks are appearing all around the sole lip of both the description on amazon indicating that the sole is made of rubber is a lie it s cheap plastic the upper parts of the slipper are well constructed but the bottoms are worthless if you think is a worthy investment for slippers that will last for only two years than by all means buy this product i have liked maybe one or two of the recipes in here most of the recipes seem to equate healthy with high fiber the informational facts are helpful none of the recipes have created memorable dishes we have a small yard and the asm is awesome except for one major issue just short of having it a year it quit working i believe that the problem is in the contact switch on the handle which is not user serviceable since it is still under warranty we contacted the manufacturer we were told to find someone to fix it that person would contact the manufacturer and let them know which part is broken the manufacturer will send them the part we pay to have it fixed send brill the bill and they will remburse us what a mess now for the good part we can t find anyone who will touch it it s a great lawn mower while it was working but the lack of a service infrastructure to support it makes it something you may want to stay away from i was going to write a longer review but then i read the review by sue lit fan sue i agree totally with everything she wrote so there is no reason to repeat so i will just say ditto there is only one song that my husband and i know on this cd but it is the beach boys we just play the one song and vol i which was terrific love it i am disappointed by vol ii i too was in that position i saw the link yesterday and made the decision today to pre order yet lo and behold the item is removed without cause i specifically checked the pre order webpage for an offer expiry date or something and found nothing how unfortunate i m saving this entire webpage right now in case they try to make this disappear too we should consider legal action beware amazon s product description is completely misleading as earlier reviewers have indicated this item is one disk with songs not the two disks with songs stated in the product description moreover only a few of the songs are among the that amazon lists this is my first scarpetta book and i must say that it was absolutely awful some of the scenes were disgusting explicit the book had a dark tone and it focused on the main characters lives a little too much everyone was depressed in the book if i hadnt known that patricia cornwell s scarpetta series was good i would not bother reading another one we tried this kettle despite the reports of its bad smell because of its great looks i can verify that this kettle produces an odor like burnt plastic or burnt rubber and even infuses the water with that odor i poured the boiled water into a pyrex bowl and took that bowl to another room where a person who has a sharp sense of smell confirmed that the water smelled bad after three days of boiling water to see if the smell would go away i gave up and i have sent it back i am just glad that amazon has such a good return policy i own three other futsal balls baden game ball vizari and uhlsport medusa this ball bounces far too much about twice as high when dropped from meters the surface also feels sponge like and is not solid enough i wish i could return it but we have already used it i bought this album and it sucked so much when i threw it out my window listening itsplatter on the ground sounded better then th album i read some of the other reviews and i have to agree with the ones who believe that someone else wrote this for her i have read most all her works and this one is at the bottom not only does the prologue tell you ending before you get started but the book could have been written in a pages if she wouldn t have repeated herself over and over and over if she did in fact write this then i suggest she takes more time and writes one great book every six months or year instead of trying to have her own book of the month club would love to rate this item and rave about its features but as yet i haven t received it would love someone to look into where it would be and come back to me asap cheers micheal this grinder was fine not great it did occasionally get stuck and spin but that wasn t a big deal the problem came when one morning i went to grind my coffee and i pushed the on button and it went all the way into the machine bye bye grinder it may be a cheaper burr grinder but it is by no means that cheap that it should only last a year do not buy not what i was looking for in a book hard to pin point what turned me off more of flow issues i guess ok so first off im not saying the concert was bad because it turns out i can t even watch it my dvd player wont play it bevause it says it s out of region so if you live on south or north america dont even waste your money there wasent even a warning or something to alert me frank muller did a great job performing this audiobook unfortunately the story is filled with stereotyped caricatures most of the characters appear nothing more than one dimensional with the attempts to broaden them oten falling flat the end also seems somewhat forced on the story here s the deal the animorphs give david the power to morph i think that david is a jerk he killed a crow for no reason disobeyed jake almost gave the animorphs away and is just a jerk i hope that everyone agrees with me anyway i love the animorphs but this book had like two funny parts in it which by the way were hilarious this book is confusing and basically boring during the helicopter i read this for a book group because we wanted something lighter than the recent downer books we ha ve been reading this was a little too light you could spot plot developments a mile away dialogue was fake maybe as a paperback at the airport when i have spare change in my pocket and will read just about anything this book is so full of errors and mistakes that it ends up being more of a waste of time than anything else in addition the writing style is amateurish almost to the point of being funny you get the impression that the author was simply transcribing sky telescope rather than thinking through what she was actually trying to say i purchased this book read it from cover to cover and cannot say that i found one piece of good information refering to examples of imaginary children no medical training much less any college degree links to dehydration do not buy this book i would resell mine but i d rather be out the five bucks that it s not worth than give it to anyone else to read do your research ezzo info i had recived this as a gift and of course wanted to try it out before its to late to bring it back in case of any problems the features were great and being able to talk through them in neat but the reception is horrible we kept hearing this constant clicking noise that wouldn t go away we tried to move it and to switch the channels but that didn t help i think the features are nice but i think thats what causes all the interference with the product i am going to take this back and get something else for you would think that this would work better i know he s young and stuff and his voice isn t fully developed but he s too young to be in the music biz couldn t he have waited till he was old enough and had a more developed voice i could not help but notice that many conservatives who have not read any books written by liberal authors will cruise through amazon com and search for works for them to rate one star i could not help but notice that the evil liberals have not returned the favor by sinking to that level dittoheads you should be ashamed i am a republican who has been disillusioned by the party s takeover by the extremist right wing perhaps i will join the masses of republican voters who are in record numbers flocking to their local governments to change their party it s because of extremists like limbaugh that these things happen no wonder amazon com didn t put up an official review of this book by a reputable source over here because no self respecting book reviewer would like this trashy and misinformed book the pieces fell out of the bottom after two weeks i weighted myself out at the doctors and i was and this scale said i was i just thought it would be a hassle to send back so i just felt like i got ripped off a little not trying to be a dick do some reserach before picking this scale first too much money for too few tracks second what on earth was he thinking with the harmonica i m a george winston fan but this cd was a disappointment worth the money only if you re a sufficient winston fanatic that you want this cd on principle to complete your winston collection otherwise spend the money on a different winston album because this one just doesn t display his talent i m also looking for the original soundtrack and wondered about this one because one of the other tracks was miranda s song or theme thanks for your review saved me from disappointment you might want to do what i ended up doing use an audio recording device on your computer play the dvd and record from that it is all talk the performances are good but the film is much too long and what could have been an excellent character study comes off over the top and theatrical hepburn is unflatteringly photographed and her mannerisms are distracting and annoying as well as her cheese grating voice sir ralph richardson stockwell and robards do well by their roles but i just couldn t get to care about their characters because the film put me to sleep within ten minutes of watching it and i had to watch it in spurts took me days to complete the viewing i loved these books but minutes into this movie i wanted to walk out of the theaters the story was changed so much that it was basically lotr save your time and your money if you have to see it what for it to come out on cable this film tackles the no so intriguing question of how bach s second cello suite would sound in the physical context of piranesi s carceri prison assuming that it had been built in the first place the deeper questions as hinted in the film probe the philosophical nature of experience and perception regrettably such questions are never clearly framed let alone answered the video brims with pseudo intellectual musings which in practice boil down to the central issue of how much reverberation to use for the final take for what it s worth some of the computer graphics are interesting you get to see yo yo playing in a digitally realized th century building all nicely done in black and white just don t expect too much more than that this is a really intense game but mostly because you re not sure when it s going to lock up on you save often and be prepared to restart the game often i have subscribed to this magazine off and on for the last years this magazine is known for the meticulously researched articles on texas history and local figures however it seems that the better quality pieces have become fewer and more far between over recent years i don t know if the magazine went through a change in ownership or what happened they still have the occasional jewel but you have to wade through a ton of fluff i bought this camera in because i wanted a cheap webcam but the video and pictures were too fuzzy and light sensitive so i packed mine up and sold it quick i tried to watch this movie i made it through over and hour of torture and shut it off maybe my expectations were too high the critics loved this movie they called it funny big name actors i thought it was junk too much unhappiness and dispair for me it was alright but i prefered flying without a broom by dj conway more though i enjoyed the numerology section of the book from what ive read and seen about amber frey im impressed the fact she could put a sentence together is very kudos for a woman like her i wonder who her ghost writter was this book neglects many of the most well know cults of today and instead speaks about the th day adventist church and those who keep the real sabbath day as written in the th commandment sunday worship is the mark of satan s authority the counterfeit to god s true sabbath therefore making it the mark of the beast it was created by the roman catholic church in a d by constantine and all those who keep sunday are unknowingly following the catholic church the mother of harlots and the dragon who controls it this is the truth edmond c gruss a former jehovah s witness mixes truth with serious error and his intentions are questionable at best beware infested with broad mites infected with virus first had to buy a miticide avid capable of killing off microscopic broad mites not easy to buy as it is mostly used commercially also the leaves came scarred and curled over all new growth is misshapen leaf margins are curly leaves are bent and hard leaves are lightly mottled all due to leaf curl virus have to throw away the plant and disinfect when i bought this album i was most definitely disappointed it was really not worth the money all the tracks in the album are mediocre especially baby phat pawn star and what we do one reasonable track is simply havin which uses a sample already by used a tribe called quest along with the electronic female narrator de la do borrow quite a bit from a tribe called quest in this album the only track that is close to being good is watch out which uses a sample from cal tjader s cubano chant but having said this the sample could have been used a lot better i think de la have just finally succumbed to the dollar which soon enough tempts and destroys hip hop artists de la soul is dead it doesnt work for laptop with processor ghz take it off from amazon i tried on win xp on my destop still doesnt work its a useless non working item amazon should not keep such itemsotherwise your reputation will go i am going to return mine i bought from amazon tech for less shop we had great difficulty finding a count dooku lightsaber for our year old for xmas in the uk so decided to try further afield it may have been shortsighted on my part but when i read the description and saw the total price including shipping i assumed that it would have been the same as the lightsabers my son already had but this one is one of the cheap ones you can obtain in toys r us for in total including shipping i paid approx so am deeply disappointed when i contact the seller they advised that the cost of shipping was the bulk of it and if i wanted a refund i would have to pay the return shipping costs so in essence it wouldn t be worthwhile i may as well have flushed the down the toilet as this was one of our son s xmas presents i am really sad that this product wasn t what i thought it would be i will think twice before buying from here again please read the description very carefully before buying i got this thinking that it s going to save counter space what a waste of i think so inclu shipping i stuck it on my fridge but it was constantly falling while pulling the paper and one day it just fell on the ground with the magnet still stuck on the fridge i scraped the remaining sticker which was on the unit got a strong adhesive wall mounting tape and now stuck it on the kitchen wall above the gas range it s even more handy then the original i purchased a new i hope toshiba dvd player the st one i received made a severe grinding noise when it was turned on i returned it for another one new i hope that one worked fine for about a week now when a dvd disk is inserted into any holder the display constantly reads no disk i m going to return it for full credit to my account too bad consumer reports gave it a very good rating this animated kids film was built around an environmental awareness agenda painting capitalism as the ruthless disregarding anything and everything in their path most imax films have a similar slant i just hope this isn t the new norm of animation films make a factual film and let your views determine truth instead of cramming this garbage down our throats i literally can t even write a full length review on this guide because it isn t even a full length guide it s pages that s the biggest red flag beyond that it s side quest section is just a chart stating where the quest is what you do and what the reward is there is literally no depth to it whatsoever even for the more complicated side quests it s actually kind of funny how bad this guide is considering in the stardust chart yup another chart it has screen shots under it depicting the harder to find locations and literally right next to each other are two of the exact same pictures like nothing is different same picture twice within an inch of each other this was obviously a pretty rushed guide for prima and a lot of effort wasn t really put into it you d be better off looking up all your information online seriously a friend recommended this and when i saw the sexy cover i thought excellent i m in for a wild ride but this is high brow chick lit without many surprises and left me unsatisfied it s a tale of self discovery sure but at the end i felt it was a weak discovery i wish i could get away from my life of material comfort job prosperity and surgeon spouse only to realize that hey maybe my life ain t so bad afterall still it s well written and moves quickly i finished it in a couple of nights but i wish it had gone deeper into the darkside of grief i wouldn t call this self destructive behavior i mean how bad can things get when you re staying at the four seasons as this character does for most of the book i like death metal sure but this album really has little worth the lyrics have little variation in themes pain killing being better than the rest and i can only hope they were written after and secondary to the music unfortunately there s nothing fantastic about any of the guitar work either martin maurais is the only reason i give this album any sort of credit i saw kataklysm open for cannibal corpse and napalm death and martin played flawlessly including when he did a lengthy and faster than light drum solo the man is amazing and i can only hope kataklysm is some sort of temporary gig until he gets to where he belongs if you re looking for sick guitar solos and technical playing kataklysm and serenity in fire probably aren t the way to go this album might be good if you just want some constant growling in the background while you re doing other things i would rather have a dead rat as president then bush he is a idiot how can you people back him up he is nuts and he is messing up our country you should all be ashamed of yourselves works great for about a year at which time the battery does not charge sufficiently to operate the knife properly replacement battery not available buy if you are happy with year of use white bread is not my thing so that s probably why i don t like this one i like herby white breads and really full bodied white breads but otherwise i always choose whole grains this one is not full bodied and has no particular flavor not interesting at all to me i received this machine last year for christmas and i loved it but it is now completely broken after only months i would not buy this if you want something that is quality and lasts for years i am very frustrated that i now have to buy a new machine to finish my christmas gifts with the warranty is void because i have no receipt because it was a gift it was beautiful in the that week we had it unfortunately the clasp didn t hold and now it s gone have another letter which is fine maybe we just got a dud or maybe it s a problem with the k um let me just say this if you re at all a fan of his first cd or even further seems forever save yourself the bucks and buy something better like the decemberists or the shins i had to return it as it was big for my house needs it did not go thru the doors sad that you have charged on its return as relocation or some thing charges you ought to refund this charged as i got chair from you poorly researched loaded with false assumptions and biased guesswork this is just another vitriolically stupid collection of smear and j accuse from this author this tripe is not worth the paper it s printed on could forum please stop publishing conservatives whose main goal is to make money from other conservatives by strategically putting hillary s name somewhere in the title or cover of their books really idiotic is kind i am a huge fan of joss whedon i love firefly i just don t get why he had to go the torture porn route for this movie the whole plot of the movie is great and it could have been a great movie i guess if you like saw and other torture porn stuff you will like this movie but if you find those kind of movies disturbing then stay away from this i just don t get it i expected much better from joss this earth was not created for humans alone but for all living beings and just because humans have taken this earth and divided up into pieces and sold those pieces to each other it doesn t mean that we own the earth other living beings have a right to live on earth as well would you find it fair if someone put you in a trap and relocated you to another land where everything is unfamiliar and strange to you we don t have any control over how we are born into this earth in what form and in what shape but we all have a right to live our full life terms on the land we are born on i agree with many of the other reviews here although this mirror has a great viewing size once you touch the mirror you might as well throw it away after trying to clean a few finger prints off the entire mirror was destroyed it scratches and smudges so bad you can t see a thing useless it was too hard on easy mode it s a first person shooter with the combat engine geared towards martial arts but in such a way that guns are still the most lethal and most logical option the concept is interesting but the playability is close to nil and winds up having an overdone feeling objects are hard to use you have to stand just right and you have to press once to pick up once again to accept and once more to use any object i m sure there s a compelling conspiracy story in there somewhere there almost always is with the archetypal amnesiac adventure hero made popular in the early s by total recall but the white on white text makes it very difficult to read what it is i really wouldn t recommend this game to anyone but enough people seem to like it that it may be worth a shot this is not a stephanie plum type novel do not be misled by the blurb on the jacket bush s writing doesn t have the zing of evanovich s stories and the first person narrative from the heroine is full of long descriptive passages detailing how someone s yard looks or what kind of food is being eaten the dialogue is fine but there s simply not enough of it to make up for the long descriptive passages detailing what kind of room the narrator is in and what things are hanging up in it the long passages made it hard for me to stay interested in the pedestrian plot sorely lacking in action and dialogue and i ended up skipping the last pages to get to the ending i will not read another book in this series but will read the next evanocich book i like my humorous heroines to have more of a sense of humour i teach english and i m always looking for books that will open the eyes of my secondary students i was excited to read staying fat after reading the many positive reviews the first pages were great wonderful character development and real problems that most kids suffer through then on page i find our dear hero staying up late watching graphically explained porno excuse me and he explains that his mother permits it because she is always completely open about sexual stuff am i to understand that being completely open about sexual stuff means having porno in the house good parents and good teachers don t expose their children students to porno i bought this cd based on the good reviews but when i opened the package it was the old buddha label cd which probably because it was used wouldn t play on either of my cd players the parts of this buddha cd that would play are a terrible remastering of a seminal performance you can get it if you want it at about not the i paid for what i thought to be a top notch import re mastering i emailed a complaint to the vendor and within three hours i got an email back from amazon not the vendor saying they have refunded my money so i sent it back and now i don t know what to order i have been a fan of firm workouts for a long time this one does not measure up maybe it s a good work out for people just getting started with physical activity not enough intensity for a good cardio workout and not enough weight work for a good resistance program this book is a sappy piece of garbage that people couldn t pay me to read again let alone watch a movie about my boys looked forward to this movie arriving for weeks literally an item i had ordered days later arrived a week before this one once it arrived i put it in their dvd player and it couldn t be played in our area basically the movie was trash which is right where it ended up i came back to see if this had been stated by the seller and it had in very small print i feel like i was fooled intentionally they knew someone purchasing this would likely miss that it is also stated on the dvd case itself that it is of foreign format it should have been put somewhere where the buy can clearly see this is a waste of time and money i don t reccomend purcasing this unless you look very very closely at what you re getting and also sellers don t sell a movie in the united states if it cannot be played in the united states my kids were terribly disappointed as was i this unit looks great and seems like a terrific design but unfortunately it works horribly don t waste your money i purchased the cam in feb after extensive comparsions to sony and canon models the cam worked perfectly for months but i now cannot put the camera in playback mode so i cannot playback video or look at pics taken the camera is a dud and i would not recommend it at all although it is attractively priced relative to the equivalent sony and cannon i am in the market again and will probably go with sony for its reputation i e mailed jvc advising them of my problem with their product and never heard back from them buy at your own risk i have read books of jl and that was the reason why i bought more books of her she is a very talented author and has mastered her craft but this book is quite disappointing i don t agree with women being so martyr and regina has been a martyr bride up to the end how i wished she at least made nicholas suffered more for what he did to her and not been so forgiving as if he s the only man on earth but ofcourse a couple united by god should not be separated by any man or any circumstance for that matter still it s not a thrilling love story i purchased packs of these clear light bulbs bulbs have blown and hazed and failed to light more bulbs globes broke off in the light socket and were extremely difficult to remove i cut a finger on the cheap glass the remaining bulbs are going in the garbage they are dangerous and i will not have them in my home i would return them but it is just not worth paying for return shipping do not buy these light bubls these cables are nice but they re not the ones advertised in the picture the ones i received can t have stackable plugs these are okay but i was expecting something else these plugs must sit at the top of a stack of connectors and nothing can be plugged in on top i m leaving the seller star as this is simply unacceptable to me i m not interested in returning my cables for a dollar refund or for the correct cables that s a miniscule amount of money at such a low price the seller knows nobody wants to deal with returns or replacements so they accidentally send us all an inferior product they realize only a small percentage of us will return the product and the rest won t bother i bought this album thinking it would be tight it s beyonce so they re gonna give her nothin but hits for her album how wrong i was crazy in love was hot baby boy was hot hip hop star was a hot mess be with you was hot the closer i get to you was a dissapointment yes me myself and i and just about every other song on the album i didn t mention espescially the closer i get to you were flat out boring and that daddy song just made me uncomfortable why was that on there i loved dangerously in love on survivor and was excited to see what she would do differently with it on this album the b tch didn t even resing the vocals she just put different production behind it and called it a day but whatever anyways i m kinda sorry i spent my dollars on that album instead of just downloading the few songs i liked on it listen to diana take out of cd player put in ella light a cigar and sip some brandy do not put back this back into cd player unless you need to sleep good band poor styling i have used pampers cruisers consistently and mistakenly bought these baby dry ones this time around it was a mistake my month old pounds sleeps hours a night and with these diapers in size up to pounds she wakes up with pee having soaked through the diaper onto her pajamas she ever peed through the diaper on a and a half hour flight not sure why they are called baby dry but they sure don t keep her dry at all i just placed another order for the cruisers but now i m stuck with of these poor diapers too when i was a kid i always looked forward to buying tv guide because a movie like this was called a melodrama any time you saw that you knew it was a horror movie this lost however even with mgm leo the lion start atmospheric b w crystal clear perfect picture and horror veteran cast lead man wasn t too convincing even daniel boones wife couldn t save this crazy man carradine lunging lon bright eyed tor silent bela forceful and demanding basil oh and a running screaming woman on fire thud that scene was pretty cool to watch if you like to see horror veterans then you should buy this other wise save your money and buy something else i used to like this when i first saw it not anymore if you really want great movies then get your hands on the comedy of terrors and also the raven both with karloff lorre price i just finished reading the book and was very disappointed with the ending it was a rushed ending and left you hanging no conclusion i was like this cannot be the end of the story but yes it was some of the story line seemed unrealistic and i would have liked more details i truly hope there is a part to this story i have an optical mouse the most common type these days and it did not work on the black surface the arm rest felt great but since i don t have one of the older ball type mice i could not use this item you might expect that based on looking at this product it should last at least a year with normal use not the case i had a package of of these things and they all wore out after months of use the only positive is that it worked fine right up until it didn t if you do buy buy in bulk cause otherwise you ll be right back here in months the movie started like if it was going to be good but then it took a very bad turn it is a very far fetched movie just horrible the story line is just stupiddo not rent this movie wish i could get my money back for this dumb movie garbage good for all of the little caucasian college kids bad for those down with the tribe from black is black days if you don t know where that reference is from you probably like this cd i was somewhat disapointed with the first one or is it the fourth but star wars episode ii is even worst it simply looks like a movie setting up another later movie but then again that is what i thought of the first one i got this movie along with another one the time machine and let me be honest to tell you that the time machine was better than star wars episode i basically wasted almost two hours watching a few good special effects the original star wars episode to were way way beyond their newer brethrens rent it to see some special effects but not much else speaker sounds good when connected via wire but could not get the wireless transmitter to work with the speakers transmitter malfunctioned on sync attempt speaker displayed search mode the light on transmitter blinked its sequence of search mode however after minutes it flashed low battery signal even after it was fully charged repeated the instructions at least times after full charges and finally decided to call saitek support in california saitek support was pleasant and after minute conversation confirming my steps and retrying tech support deduced that the wireless transmitter was malfunctioned and offered an exchange told him that i just bought it from amazon so got my refund from amazon this is definitely not for kids who are starting to read the words are going across the screen too fast my yr old had difficulty keeping up as an adult had i not known the story i could not follow i do applaud the fact that it talks about punctuation use of comma s and full stops but then that is basically it it lacked the depth and interest of the talking letter factory had i read the other reviews first on this one i would have never bought it i think that these dolls are sending a bad message to girls my age why do they have to look so trashy their make up is so thick and clothes hardly cover their butts my mom taught me that a girl can look nice without looking like that i threw away the last doll i got for my birthday don t let apple continue ripping you off don t buy their products search for other usp power adaptors search under ipod usb travel adapter apple doesn t have a right to rip you off after you paid hundreds of dollars for your ipod i bought this mixer from sears months ago it is now junk the motor runs but the beaters don t turn i emailed sunbeam and they have not bothered to email me back i had this watch for a week now days ago i took a bath with it and i got humidity on the glass and i has not go away i live in uruguay so is not like i can use the warranty may be is just this one that is a defective one but i ve seen the same comment in other reviews if you have one and you did some swimming or something with no problems please leave a comment thank you the special edition is fantastic but it is the same as the edition the theatrical version sounded better on vhs tv etc they blew it the sound is low no bass awful i bought this to get the theatrical version with great sound there are moments on that version not on the special edition like when elvis tries to find a working microphone the out of aint bad part i cant believe in they can do no better than this it almost a nd generation ripoff of the vhs ps this is not elvis fault he gives great performances ruined by the thumblefisted production crew they filmed shows in different outfits give me the master tapes and i would produce a hour extravaganza for all elvis fans horrible job im a huge blink fan and this just might be their worst cd ever second to a good charlotte cd of mine this by far the worst album i own do not buy this cd the only good song is online songs and its not worth the or whatever it is well for starters i picked up this book after reading an interview that ms steffans did with vibe magazine last year i had expected this book to talk solely about ms steffans and her perspective of her life as a video vixen aka video ho but my expectations weren t fulfilled the most disappointing aspect of this book was that ms steffans just seemed to be throwing dirt around about a lot of people with big names i thought it was very tasteless and tacky to highlight a few big names and then to cower and leave out everyone saying that the ones she left out were still her friends i almost laughed aloud when i read that statment but to top of all of the mud slinging the book was very poorly written i m not sure how this book got throught the publisher there were many typos and fragments throughout the book if you have nothing better to do i would suggest renting this book from the local library but rest asure that you won t read it again it did not even last two weeks the cocking mechanism broke rendering the gun unusable a thin plastic pin broke that pulls back the metal spring assembly to load and cock the gun they should have made the pin out of metal too bad design stay away from this one bluish is the story of a young girl dreenie who lives in new york city she lives with an annoying little sister and an almost more annoying best friend tuli the book tells the story of these three girls befriending a girl at school who no one likes the kids call her bluish she sits alone in a wheelchair when she comes to school and talks to no one she has no hair only hats and she is so sickly pale her skin has a blue tint at first the girls fear her but through the story they accept her as one of their own this book virginia hamilton is written very choppy it jumps around a lot and doesn t stick to one theme it is very repetitive and at times i even thought i was rereading a page i would not reccommend this book don t bother you cannot hear any sound unless you hold the back of the phone to your ear even then it is low purchased the khb in july absolutely loved it and used it probably a half dozen times then while i was mixing ingredients for a cake over the holidays the mixer just stopped working like someone else mentioned it was fairly hot to the touch i let it rest and tried to plug it in another day but it s completely dead the good thing is kitchen aid will replace it completely since it s within one year of purchase i just called the company and the woman told me this particular model has been discontinued so we shall see whether the new model i receive lasts as long as this one i m not entirely sure how to explain this book as i didn t understand a word of it i have also read the analytics of information and uncertainty another book with heavy mathematical content but one i found to be very good in scope and application this text however seems to overuse mathematical methods economics is not about learning propositional mathematics and just flicking through this book there are models i already know like the edgeworth box diagram as applied to payoff states and it was in a totally unrecognisable form even the fundamental theorems of welfare economics were garbled i would heartily recommend this text to anyone who has completed nd year university level mathematics courses or is a university lecturer in economics if you re just an ordinary graduate with little interest in deep mathematical methods there are better books out there we wish we had not wasted our money on this juvenile violent lousily acted series how this survived as many seasons as it did is beyond our comprehension our eyes glazed over right from the first segment we couldn t believe how bad it was the second segment never made it into the dvd player what a waste of time\n"
